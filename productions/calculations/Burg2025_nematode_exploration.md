## Context
[[nematode]] are the most abundant taxon for soil animals, currently not covered in existing biodiversity indicators.
nematodes are well studied and there are lots of data points in many global [[biome]] and [[ecoregion]], under several [[land use]], and could lead to the definition of LCA CFs.

# Discussion
The database focuses on [[species abudance]] and not on [[species richness]] which makes it impossible to extrapolate to [[relative species loss]].
Maybe there could be indicators focusing on functional groups, such as [[food web|trophic groups]].
The land cover dataset ([[WORLDCOVER]]) is accurate at 10m with sometimes local
