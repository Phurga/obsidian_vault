### global soil degradation
Soils are degrading at alarming rates globally [@FAO2015_StatusWorlds] and 60% of European soils are considered degraded [@Panagos2024_HowEU]. Degraded soils show degraded soil functionning. Soil functions include soil structure maintenance, water regulation, contaminant regulation, nutrient cycling, carbon storage and biodiversity support [@INRAE2025_PreserverQualite]. Being at the origin of terrestrial ecosystem fertility, healthy soils are critical to ecosystem functioning and its associated prosivision of ecosystem services. Because of this soils are increasingly captured in environmental policies [@EuropeanCommission2025_ProposalDirective]. 
### soil formation
Soil is slowly formed under the influence of climate, relief, parent material (bedrock) and living organisms. These factors drive the formation and stabilisation of organo-mineral aggregates over long periods of time [@FAO2015_StatusWorlds;@Huggett1998_SoilChronosequences;@EuropeanCommission2016_GlobalSoil]. This makes soil a non renewable resource at generational scale although soil formation can be significantly fastened with human intervention [@Burger2023_FastAgricultural].
### soil biodiversity
Soils show outstanding biodiversity, hosting more than half of species on Earth [@Anthony2023_EnumeratingSoil]. Soils show complex structure with multi-scale porosity and great surface area (see figure below). Soil is also a medium with diverse forms of energy, carbon and nutrient also often in scarce amounts. Physico-chemical properties (pH, soil organic carbon sources, temperature, humidity) of this medium vary largely across the world and at micro scales. This diversity of habitat drives a high diversity of life forms [@Fierer2009_GlobalPatterns;@Labouyrie2023_PatternsSoil;@EuropeanCommission2016_GlobalSoil].

### life forms in the soil
Most soil organisms in number of species are microorganisms such as bacteria or fungi [@Anthony2023_EnumeratingSoil]. Most soil organisms in abundance are nematodes [@VanDenHoogen2019_SoilNematode]. Soil also hosts large amounts of arthropods, from microarthropods such as springtails, to carnivorous macroarthropods including ants and termites[@Anthony2023_EnumeratingSoil;@Bar-On2018_BiomassDistribution]0. Invertebrates are also major contributors of ecosystem functions, especially earthworms (annelids) which represent a significant portion of soil living biomass [@Bar-On2018_BiomassDistribution].
### species might not be a good angle to study soil biodiversity
We can have estimates of how many different species are in the soil but it is unlikely that we will ever inventory them all. Some conservation approaches focus on habitat protection and cornerstone species [@FAO2025_HowConserve]. Other approaches focus on ecosystem function and multi-trophic soil biodiversity models [@Hedde2022_CommonFramework;@Calderon-Sanou2022_BetterUnderstanding;@Cerna2025_LimitsPromises].
### monitoring soil biodiversity
It is not necessary to inventory all species to study biodiversity loss: environmental DNA analysis, and especially DNA metabarcoding allows to collect soil sample, extract DNA fragments of millions of organisms and extract DNA markers (sections) to identify an organism. Identification is different from definition. Identifying an organism refers to reading its DNA. Based on the similarity (of specific DNA sections) with other organisms, one can group organisms together, without having to observe nor describe the organism morphology or physiology, nor even read any full genome.

It is then possible to derive species counts or abundance counts at local scale that can be used to derive biodiversity metrics at local or regional scale. Metrics can be used to derive spatial, temporal or environmental patterns, such as the influence of human land use intensity on soil biodiversity [@Labouyrie2023_PatternsSoil].cmd
### soil quality
Soil quality is measured in reference to a reference soil state. Some simplified indicators use soil organic matter (SOM) or soil organic carbon values as indicators of soil quality, many dimensions of soil quality being strongly correlated to SOM content.
