## hook
What is the contribution of our material consumption to the ecologic crisis ? With the environmentalist movement developping in the end 20th century, scholars are researching methods to answer such questions. 
## global products and life cycle analysis
### global products
Most modern products consumed in local markets are in fact linked to a global industrial and commercial network. Assessing the environmental impacts of these products first requires defining the complete network of activities it involves. It also requires being able to define the environmental impacts of any of these activities, accounting for regional contexts. 
### life cycle analysis
The life cycle assessment (LCA) framework [@ISO2006_ISO14040] aims at adressing this challenge, by considering the environmental impacts of a product through a "product system" perspective. This product system links all activities involved with the use of the product, both upstream (production, logistics etc) and downstream (end of life treatments). Any activity can be brought down to a list of exchanges with the environment (elementary flows), marking a potential human-induced environmental impact. The framework considers a range of environmental issues (such as climate change, eutrophication, water scarcity) to which elementary flows are linked to via coefficients (characterization factors) translating exchanges with the environment into environmental impacts. A cause-effect chain can be established to derive environmental issues results into damage on humans or biodiversity [@UNEP2016_GlobalGuidance; @Verones2017_LCIAFramework].
## nature valuation and protection
### ecosystem quality or biodiversity
Human value nature for different reasons. Under an anthropocentric paradigm, nature is considered as a resource for human to live from. Under a biocentric paradigm, nature is considered as a system composed of non-human beings with a right to exist regardless of their relation to humans [@IPBES2022_SummaryPolicymakers].

These two paradigms lead to the definition of two end goals in social policies: anthropocentrism leads to protecting human beings and biocentrism leads to protecting non-human beings as well. Areas of protection in LCA have evolved over time and are still debated. Especially, how damage on the natural environment should be considered has long been debated [@Koellner2013_UNEPSETACGuideline; @Curran2016_HowWell; @Verones2017_LCIAFramework; @Debarre2025_RevampingLCIA]. The term biodiversity appears to be more aligned with concepts of conservation biology and environmental policy [@Curran2016_HowWell;@Soule1985_WhatConservation;@IPBES2019_GlobalAssessment;@CBD2011_ConventionBiological] and will be used as an area of protection which purpose is to preserve non-human beings from human influence. This is close to "ecosystem quality", but the latter has a variety of interpretation and has no scientific definition outside life cycle assessment.
### biodiversity and ecosystem services
Considering the instrumental value of nature is aligned with the ecosystem services framework [@Costanza1997_ValueWorlds;@FabisConsultingLtd2023_CommonInternational]. Biodiversity affects ecosystems functionning and thus the delivery of ecosystem services [@IPBES2019_GlobalAssessment]. Biodiversity is correlated with ecosystem functioning (e.g. productivity, resilience) and thus biodiversity is known to correlate with ecosystem services [@Hooper2005_EffectsBiodiversity;@Oliver2015_BiodiversityResilience]. However, quantifying any loss of services due to the degradation of ecosystems is not the focus of this area of protection. [@Debarre2025_RevampingLCIA] proposes a cause-effect pathway relating biodiversity (as ecosystem quality) and ecosystem services.

## biodiversity
Biological diversity, "biodiversity", is the diversity of life. But the diversity of life can be observed at different levels of organisation and life forms are valuable in multiple aspects. The convention on biological diversity (CBD) defines biodiversity as "the variability among living organisms from all sources including, inter alia, terrestrial, marine and other aquatic ecosystems and the ecological complexes of which they are part; this includes diversity within species, between species and of ecosystems" [@CBD2011_ConventionBiological].
### species
This definition highlights the need to consider diversity beyond species, because the latter has been, and still is, subject to particular focus. Species is a useful concept in biology and ecology, although one definition fitting all life forms is challenging [@Anthony2023_EnumeratingSoil;@Doolittle2006_GenomicsBacterial]. It is also debatted if and why species have value beyond the value of the organisms of its population, or beyond any instrumental value to us [@Sandler2010_ValueSpecies]. Regardless of any ethical reasoning, some people care for the existence of some species and try to preserve its populations as parts of ecological communities. Regional and global scale conservation programs attempt to identify biodiversity hotspots to focus conservation efforts on [@CBD2022_KunmingMontrealGlobal], and regional species inventories is a common approach to identify these [@GBF2025_A3Red].

The simplest use of species inventories is to derive species richness indicators, i.e. the number of species found in an area, usually accounting for taxon related biases. More refined species indicators can be used, accounting for taxonomic species are different from each other (distinctiveness). Indices of ecological community can be constructed not only from species presence and absence but also accounting for species populations, such as the Shannon index [@Santini2017_AssessingSuitability]. The diversity of organisms traits (such as morphology and physiology) can be accounted for with functional diversity approaches [@Violle2007_LetConcept], valuing species contributions to ecosystems function. Phylogenetic diversity accounts for the "evolutionary history carried" by the species. This diversity can be valued as such [@Sandler2010_ValueSpecies], or because it is associated to adapative potential (option value) [@Faith1992_ConservationEvaluation;@IPBES2019_GlobalAssessment].
### multiple dimensions to biodiversity
The CBD definition provides indications about several dimensions to account for in biodiversity. The essential biodiversity variables framework [@Pereira2013_EssentialBiodiversity;@GEOBON2025_WhatAre] proposes a set of 6 classes of variables to capture when monitoring biodiversity:
- genetic composition
- species population
- species traits
- community composition  
- ecosystem structure
- ecosystem function

It is possible to derive measurable variables from each of these classes, assess biodiversity levels and establish temporal and spatial trends [@Jetz2019_EssentialBiodiversity].
The Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) [@CBD2022_KunmingMontrealGlobal] proposes a set of targets to achieve by 2030. Some targets are at ecosystem level, such as target 1: "plan and manage all areas to reduce biodiversity loss", ^[https://www.gbf-indicators.org/metadata/headline/A-1] . Some are at genes (and species) level, such as target 4: "halt species extinction, protect genetic diversity and manage human-wildlife conflicts", with the operational indicator "effective population size 500" ^[https://www.gbf-indicators.org/metadata/headline/A-4] monitoring the maintenance of genetic diversity and evolutionary potential among species.
## a reducing biodiversity
Natural ecosystems are being degraded by human activities at increasing rates [@McGill2015_FifteenForms;@IPBES2019_GlobalAssessment]. Ecosystem degradation 
### land use is the main driver
Herein we will focus on how land transformed for human activities is a degraded habitat for wildlife.
