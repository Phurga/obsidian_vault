Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a tool to quantify potential environmental impacts of systems and products involved in with value chains. [@ISO2006_ISO14040]. Loss of biodiversity due to human activities, mostly activities associated to material consumption, is a growing concern for society. Protection of biodiversity is an objective in itself but also for the associated potential loss of ecosystem function and contribution to humans [@IPBES2019_GlobalAssessment;@MEA2005_EcosystemsHuman].

@IPBES2019_GlobalAssessment defines the main drivers of biodiversity loss. For terrestrial ecosystems, land use change, which means loss of habitat from the perspective of non-human beings, is described as the most influential driver of biodiversity loss. The potential impacts of land use on biodiversity has been the focus of methodological developments for more than two decades in the LCA community [@Curran2016_HowWell;@Damiani2023_CriticalReview]. Methods have been refined, increasing the geographical coverage and regionalisation, increasing the taxonomical coverage, accounting for specific limitations such as land use-taxon affinity and habitat fragmentation [@Scherer2023_BiodiversityImpact].

Currently, most methodological developments 1/ measure degradation of biodiversity through relative loss of native species, also known as potential diseappeared fraction of species (PDF), and 2/ model this loss using derivates of the species-area relationship (SAR) [@MacArthur2001_TheoryIsland;@Kuipers2021_ConsideringHabitat]. They also differentiate local biodiversity loss (change in ecological community) and global biodiversity loss (extinction of species). Among this class of methods, @Scherer2023_BiodiversityImpact is currently the most advanced method for assessing the life cycle impacts of land use on biodiversity loss.

One limitation of this class of methods remains the limited taxonomical coverage. Application at global scale involves important data requirements, especially for species geographical coverage [@IUCN2025_IUCNRed] and species-habitat affinity [@Hudson2017_DatabasePREDICTS]. However, global soils host most of global species [@Anthony2023_EnumeratingSoil]. Taxa with highest species count are bacteria (and archae), arthropods, nematodes and fungi. All these taxa are not covered in \@IUCN2025_IUCNRed [^1], leading to a distorded representation of species biodiversity.

Such a distrotion is problematic for several reasons. Global patterns of above below ground biodiversity do not always follow patterns of above ground biodiversity [@Cameron2019_GlobalMismatches]. The response of microorganisms to land use is not aligned with response of plants and vertebrates [@Labouyrie2023_PatternsSoil;@Newbold2016_GlobalPatterns]. It also questions how a species-centric paradigm is inclusive of all life forms when monitoring biodiversity.

Biodiversity conservation programs have been focusing on the protection of individual species [@IUCN2025_IUCNRed]. Considering existence value to species [^2] is the ethical basis for using species based indicators in LCA. But soil microrganisms are difficult to observe and identify. It is unlikely that we will ever identify all species found in the soil [@FAO2025_HowConserve], and the existence value of soil microorganisms is limited for the average citizen.

Estimating loss of species richness does not require species identification for enumeration only, which is made possible at large scale using metabarcoding of environmental DNA [ref]. 

Although species protection has been central in biodiversity conservation programs, it is unlikely that we will ever identify all species found in the soil or define which ones are threathened for extinction [@FAO2025_HowConserve;@Weinbauer2007_ExtinctionMicrobes]. 
Given the microscopic nature of soil microorganisms, such organisms find a diversity of habitat at scales different from plots of land used by humans. It is likely that the observed SAR for microbes are orders of magnited lower than for macrobes [@Green2004_SpatialScaling].

[^1]: With the exception of a few mushroom forming fungi.  The red list has 1300 species over millions estimated to exist.

[^2]: Considering existence value for species beyond individual organisms constituting the species population, and beyond ecosytem functions filled by the population.
