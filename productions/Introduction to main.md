Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a tool to quantify potential environmental impacts of systems and products involved in with value chains. [@ISO2006_ISO14040]. Loss of biodiversity due to human activities, mostly activities associated to material consumption, is a growing concern for society. Protection of biodiversity is an objective in itself but also for the associated potential loss of ecosystem function and contribution to humans [@IPBES2019_GlobalAssessment;@MEA2005_EcosystemsHuman].

@IPBES2019_GlobalAssessment defines the main drivers of biodiversity loss. For terrestrial ecosystems, land use change, which means loss of habitat from the perspective of non-human beings, is described as the most influential driver of biodiversity loss. The potential impacts of land use on biodiversity has been the focus of methodological developments for more than two decades in the LCA community [@Curran2016_HowWell;@Damiani2023_CriticalReview]. Methods have been refined, increasing the geographical coverage and regionalisation, increasing the taxonomical coverage, accounting for specific limitations such as land use-taxon affinity and habitat fragmentation [@Scherer2023_BiodiversityImpact].

Currently, most methodological developments 1/ measure degradation of biodiversity through relative loss of native species, also known as potential diseappeared fraction of species (PDF), and 2/ model this loss using derivates of the species-area relationship (SAR) [@MacArthur2001_TheoryIsland;@Kuipers2021_ConsideringHabitat]. They also differentiate local biodiversity loss (change in ecological community) and global biodiversity loss (extinction of species). Among this class of methods, @Scherer2023_BiodiversityImpact is currently the most advanced method for assessing the life cycle impacts of land use on biodiversity loss.

One limitation of this class of methods remains the limited taxonomical coverage. Application at global scale involves important data requirements, especially for species geographical coverage [@IUCN2025_IUCNRed] and species-habitat affinity [@Hudson2017_DatabasePREDICTS]. However, global soils host most of global species [@Anthony2023_EnumeratingSoil]. Taxa with highest species count are bacteria (and archae), arthropods, nematodes and fungi. All these taxa are not covered in \@IUCN2025_IUCNRed [^1], leading to a distorded representation of species biodiversity.

Such a distrotion is problematic for several reasons. Global patterns of above below ground biodiversity do not always follow patterns of above ground biodiversity [@Cameron2019_GlobalMismatches]. The response of microorganisms to land use is not aligned with response of plants and vertebrates [@Labouyrie2023_PatternsSoil;@Newbold2016_GlobalPatterns]. Compared to macrobial communities, microbial communities change little across space. This challenges the use of a SAR-based approach for microbes to estimate regional species loss. Microbial taxons show much smaller z-values, leading to insignificant richness loss per unit of area loss [@Storch2012_UniversalSpecies;@Green2006_SpatialScaling].

Beyond local or regional changes in species richness, microbes tend to show little endemism [@Doolittle1999_PhylogeneticClassification] and species extinction risk is not a social concern [@Weinbauer2007_ExtinctionMicrobes].

It also questions how a species-centric paradigm is inclusive of all life forms when monitoring biodiversity. One ethical basis of biodiversity conservation programs have been to consider existence value to individual species[^2] [@Sandler2010_ValueSpecies;@Himes2024_WhyNature;@FAO2025_HowConserve], motivating actions to protect their native populations [@IUCN2025_IUCNRed]. Soil microrganisms are difficult to observe and identify and it is unlikely that we will ever identify all species found in the soil. The existence value of soil microorganisms is limited for the average citizen, habitat or ecosystem function centric approaches are envisaged [@FAO2025_HowConserve].

Still, there is interest for the description and conservation of soil ecological communities. Modern molecular techniques such as the metabarcoding of environmental DNA (eDNA) are promising to do so [@Orgiazzi2015_SoilBiodiversity]. However, it is difficult to obtain reliable species diversity metrics (richness, abundance) using these techniques [@Calderon-Sanou2020_EnvironmentalDNA;@Edgar2025_InterpretingCounts]. @Labouyrie2023_PatternsSoil provides patterns in soil microbial diversity across Europe, identifying drivers of bacterial and fungal richness and composition, using the LUCAS Soil eDNA barcodes dataset [@Orgiazzi2018_LUCASSoil].

@Labouyrie2023_PatternsSoil quantifies microbial richness using (z)OTUs, (zero distance) operational taxonomic units, because definitions of species for bacteria is an open problem [@Gevers2005_ReevaluatingProkaryotic].
