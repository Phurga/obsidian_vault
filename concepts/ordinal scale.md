A good example of an ordinal scale is a satisfaction survey, with possible values going from "very satisfied" (5 stars) to "very unsatisfied" (1 star).
An ordinal scale is scale whose elements can be ordered ($a$ is after $b$, $b$ is before $c$) and by extension it allows for comparisons. Ordinal elements are categorical.
Such scale does not support addition or multiplication, because elements of the scale are not equidistant ($a$ is not $n$ times $b$, and $a$ + $b$ is not equal to $c$ or any other possible value on the scale).

[[Lindner, Jan Paul]] likes to mention ordinal scales in its articles, eg [[Lindner2019_ValuingBiodiversity]] where he uses an ordinal scale for [[naturalness|hemeroby]].

Also see [[cardinal scale]].
Nominal scales is only for classification (differentiation) and support neither comparison nor addition or multiplication.
