Soil is formed under the influence of these main factors:
- [[climate]]
- [[relief]] (slope, altitude, orientation)
- [[soil biodiversity|living organisms]]
- [[soil types|parent material]]
- time

[[soil]] formation (pedogenesis) is a slow process. Formation of 30 cm of topsoil can take up to 10k years [[FAO2020_Stateknowledge]], [[Huggett1998_Soilchronosequences]].
Technosols can speed up the process using samples from healthy soils in the same [[ecosystem]].
