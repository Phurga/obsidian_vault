**Soil is formed (pedogenesis)** under the influence of these main factors:
- [[climate]]
- [[relief]] (slope, altitude, orientation)
- [[soil biodiversity|living organisms]]
- [[soil type|parent material]]
- time. [[FAO2020_StateKnowledge]]

This is a slow process. Formation of 30 cm of topsoil can take up to 10k years [[FAO2020_StateKnowledge]], [[Huggett1998_SoilChronosequences]]. Technosols can speed up the process using samples from healthy soils in the same [[ecosystem]]. [[Burger2023_Fastagricultural]] has shown topsoil reformation can be sped up through virtuous [[land management|land management practices]] (26 years to reconstitute top soil vs milenia for natural processes).
