**Algae** are [[prokaryotes]] able to perform photosynthesis, and can be of many taxons. Definition seems fuzzy.
Prokaryotes so [[cyanobacteria]] are supposed to be no algae.

There are many algae in [[soil|soils]] and they are the source of a significant portion of photosynthetic carbon and also source of oxygen inside the soil. They only live in the first few milimeters. [[O2 production]], [[carbon transformation]].

[[soil structure]]: algae can create [[soil biological crusts]] and contribute to [[soil aggregate]] formation, preventing soil erosion, reduce evaporation and increase water storage.

Algae are influenced by herbicides, hindering their capacity to forme soil aggregates. Algae can decompose some pesticides.
