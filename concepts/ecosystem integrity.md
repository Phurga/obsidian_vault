>Ecological integrity is a holistic way to conceive of the health of an ecosystem, along a full gradient from highly intact to highly degraded. _Structure_ refers to physical characteristics, such as a forest with three-dimensional complexity, or a river with high connectivity. _Function_ refers to ecological processes such as fish biomass production or wetland nutrient cycling. _Composition_ refers to the presence, abundance or richness of species, populations or genetic units.
