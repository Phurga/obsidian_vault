**Ecosystem integrity** is a tentative conceptualisation of the three dimensions of species, [[composition, structure, function]]. It is closely linked to concepts of [[naturalness]] or [[resilience]].

The [[convention on biological diversity]] defines ecosystem integrity as follows:
>The integrity of ecosystems is broadly defined by the status of their component species and the ecological processes they support and require. Integrity can be assessed by the degree of change (loss and gain) in the set of species and associated processes observed within an ecosystem and its habitats. The [[species habitat index]] (SHI) measures this change and specifically captures alterations in the connectivity and ecological intactness of ecosystems.

>[!warning] The [[ecosystem integrity index]] is not a widely used metric for ecosystem integrity.

Detailed definition from the [wildlife conservation society (WCS)](https://newsroom.wcs.org/News-Releases/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/23687/Ecological-Integrity-Central-to-the-Global-Biodiversity-Framework-and-the-UNFCCC-Paris-Agreement.aspx):
>Ecological integrity is a holistic way to conceive of the health of an ecosystem, along a full gradient from highly intact to highly degraded. _Structure_ refers to physical characteristics, such as a forest with three-dimensional complexity, or a river with high connectivity. _Function_ refers to ecological processes such as fish biomass production or wetland nutrient cycling. _Composition_ refers to the presence, abundance or richness of species, populations or genetic units.
