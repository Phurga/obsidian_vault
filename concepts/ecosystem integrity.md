**Ecosystem integrity** is a tentative conceptualisation of the three dimensions of species, [[composition, structure, function]]. It is closely linked to concepts of [[naturalness]] or [[resilience]].

The [[convention on biological diversity]] defines ecosystem integrity as follows:
>The integrity of ecosystems is broadly defined by the status of their component species and the ecological processes they support and require. Integrity can be assessed by the degree of change (loss and gain) in the set of species and associated processes observed within an ecosystem and its habitats. The [[species habitat index]] (SHI) measures this change and specifically captures alterations in the connectivity and ecological intactness of ecosystems.

>[!warning] The [[ecosystem integrity index]] is not a widely used metric for ecosystem integrity.
