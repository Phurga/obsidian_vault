[[Soil]]s are currently facing pressures leading to their fast degradation (loss of [[soil quality]]) on a global scale.

[[FAO2020_Stateknowledge]] identifies a list of key pressures:
- [[habitat transformation|land use change]] such as [[deforestation]] and [[urbanization]].
- [[land use intensity|agricultural intensification]] (tillage, overfertilisation, ph correction, pesticides, monocultures)
- loss of [[soil organic matter]] and especially organic carbon.
- [[soil compaction]]
- [[soil sealing]]
- soil [[acidification]]
- [[nutrient cycling|nutrient imbalance]]
- [[pollution]] (industrial, nuclear)
- [[salinization]] and [[salinization|sodification]]
- [[desertification]]
- [[wildfires]]
- [[erosion]] and landslides
- [[invasive alien species]]

 [[potential threats to biological functions]] considers also:
 - [[habitat fragmentation]]
 - use of [[GMO]]
but does not consider:
