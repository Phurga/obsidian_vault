**Soils are currently facing pressures** leading to their fast degradation (loss of [[soil quality]]) on a global scale ([[FAO2015_StatusWorlds]]).

[[FAO2020_StateKnowledge]] identifies a list of key pressures:
- [[habitat transformation|land use change]] such as [[deforestation]] and [[urbanization]].
- [[land use intensity|agricultural intensification]] (tillage, overfertilisation, ph correction, pesticides, monocultures)
- loss of [[soil organic matter]] and especially organic carbon.
- [[soil compaction]]
- [[soil sealing]]
- soil [[acidification]]
- [[nutrient cycling|nutrient imbalance]]
- [[pollution]] (industrial, nuclear)
- [[salinization]] and [[salinization|sodification]]
- [[desertification]]
- [[wildfires]]
- [[erosion]] and landslides
- [[invasive alien species]]

The list of [[potential threats to biological functions]], led by the [[European Union Soil Observatory|EUSO]] considers also:
 - [[habitat fragmentation]]
 - use of [[GMO]]

[[INRAE2025_PreserverQualite]] proposes a classification, without double counting ( #todo/notsure )
- [[artificialization]] ([[soil sealing]])
- loss of [[biodiversity]]
- loss of [[soil organic matter|SOC]]
- [[pollution]]
- [[nutrient cycling|nutrient imbalance]]
- [[soil compaction]]
- [[salinization]]
- [[erosion]]

"[[La fresque du sol]]" is a way of classifying and representing the causal effects from human activities on soil quality and their consequences:
