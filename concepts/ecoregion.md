An **ecological region (ecoregion)** is a geographical unit with similar [[biodiversity]] and [[ecosystem]]s. This similarities are based on a shared environmental characteristics (climate, precipitation, elevation, aridity being the main ones).
Ecoregions are assigned a [[biome]]. For instance, the "Corsican montane broadleaf and mixed forests" ecoregion is in the "mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub" biome.

The main ecoregion list currently in use is [[Dinerstein2017_EcoregionBasedApproach]], based on the former work done in [[Olson2001_TerrestrialEcoregions]] for the [[world wildlife fund]].
