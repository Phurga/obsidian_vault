An ecological region (ecoregion) is a geographical unit with similar [[biodiversity]] and [[ecosystem]]s. This similarities are based on a shared environmental characteristics (climate, precipitation, elevation, aridity being the main ones).
Ecoregions are assigned a [[biome]]. For instance, the "Corsican montane broadleaf and mixed forests" ecoregion is in the "mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub" biome.

The main ecoregion list currently in use is [[Olson1998_Global200]]. This concept is mainly linked with WWF's work.
