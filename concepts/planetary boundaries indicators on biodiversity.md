There are two [[measures of biodiversity|indicators for biodiversity]] in the [[planetary boundaries]] framework.

One focuses on genetic diversity (incl species diversity).
One focuses on functional diversity.

## critics
[[Samper2009_Planetaryboundaries]] critiques the biodiversity indicator for [[planetary boundaries]], which is species extinction rate. His main problems are: 
- biodiversity measurement is not a physical measurement ([[philosophical quantity]]).
- causal chains between species loss and environmental condition changes is poorly understood.
- a single variable for biodiversity change is not useful, mostly because there is so high variability in how environmental change affects different taxon (amphibians disappear faster than birds).

He proposes better indicators:
- risk of disappearing species *families* ([[taxa aggregation]])
- loss of phylogenetic history ([[phylogenetic diversity]])
