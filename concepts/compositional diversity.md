**Compositional diversity** is the most conventional type of biodiversity we encounter, e.g. the variability of the organisms constituting an ecosystem or the diversity of ecoystems constituting a landscape. **Species composition** refers to what species constitute an [[biocenosis|ecological community]].

Composition is a matter of [[species richness]] and [[species abudance]]. Combined measures are considered as [[species diversity]].
# indicators
- species richness
	- [[relative species loss]]
- species abudance
	- [[mean species abundance]] (MSA)
- species diversity
	- [[shannon index]]
	- [[sorensen similarity index]]
	- [[fischer alpha]] (used in [[biodiversity damage potential]])

[[Santini2017_Assessingsuitability]] seems to advise for using sorensen index and species richness as simple yet effective indicators for composition changes.
## Further use of such indicators
In [[LCA]] compositional indicators are used to derive more complex indicators ([[species extinction risk]], [[functional diversity]] etc, see [[LCIA method on ecosystem quality]]

On chosing simple and effective indicators:

> While metrics such as phylogenetic and functional diversity may also be useful, scientists should consider whether they provide added value in terms of conveying useful information to end-users such as conservation managers. For example, phylogenetic diversity and functional richness are often correlated with species richness ([Schipper et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320716303305?ref=pdf_download&fr=RR-2&rr=935e09b06db3d159#bb0275)). Generally, a small set of complementary and conceptually simple metrics is more transparent, intuitive and informative for policy makers on the underlying causes of changes in biodiversity (e.g. [Latombe et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320716303305?ref=pdf_download&fr=RR-2&rr=935e09b06db3d159#bb0175) for invasive species).
