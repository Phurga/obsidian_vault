**Compositional diversity** is the most conventional type of biodiversity we encounter, e.g. the variability of the organisms constituting an ecosystem or the diversity of ecoystems constituting a landscape. **Species composition** refers to what species constitute an [[biocenosis|ecological community]].

Composition is a matter of [[species richness]] and [[species abudance]]. Combined measures are considered as [[species diversity]].

Species composition was also found to be a good proxy for ecosystem functioning #todo/refneeded
