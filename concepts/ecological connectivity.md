**Ecological connectivity** is the degree of connection between [[biotope|habitat]]s in a [[landscape]]. Connectivity is species specific: different organisms do not have the same mobility (**dispersal** ability).

The [[species-area relationship]] states that higher richness is achieved with larger natural habitats, but species mobility induce connectivity among [[habitat fragmentation|fragmented habitat]]s leading to increased [[equivalent connected area]] of natural habitat at regional scale.

Ecological connectivity of landscapes can be increased by introducing **natural corridor**s.
