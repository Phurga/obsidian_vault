The current framework for land use impacts on biodiversity is currently articulated around the species area relationship.

Following this fundament requires acknowledging the following principles:
1. area of protection
	- one of the objectives of a life cycle assessment study is to assess human impacts on ecosystem quality, i.e. damages on the intrinsic value of nature, especially its biotic component
	- the study should highlight human activities known for their adverse impacts on ecosystem quality
	- the study should amplify the measured damage for locations most sensitive to these human activities
	- the study should allow for interpretability on the impact pathway (between human activities and ecosytem quality degradation)
2. land use is an impact category
	- land use has intrinsic impacts on the considered AOP
		- there is no double counting with other impact categories, mainly associated to the emissions of chemical substances to the environment (ecotoxicity, acidification, eutrophication)
		- this intrinsic impact can be modeled using the species area relationship
	- there are scientific evidences linking human activities with land use impacts
3. metric
	- there exists a measure for the intrinsic value of nature
	- this measure can be computed from data that can be collected
	- damage on ecosystem quality at regional level can be represented with changes in species composition
		- changes in species composition can be represented with loss of species
			- loss of endemic species should be quantified relative to a fully natural reference state, accounting only for native species
	- damage on ecosystem quality at global level can be represented with species extinction risk
