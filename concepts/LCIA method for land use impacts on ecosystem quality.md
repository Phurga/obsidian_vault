### Graphical summary

## Rationale
The main driver of [[biodiversity]] loss is [[habitat transformation|habitat loss]], occuring when human tranform natural land for its own benefit (agriculture for food production, forestry for timber production, urban for living space etc).

#todo/draft
This is a hot topic in [[life cycle assessment]]. There is extended litterature on how to account for habitat loss through a LCA compliant [[impact pathway]] "[[elementary flow]]" (EF) > "[[midpoint]]" > "[[endpoint]]" framework ([[Horn2022_LandUse]], [[UNEP2019_GlobalGuidance]], [[Koellner2013_PrinciplesLife]], [[MilaiCanals2007_KeyElements]], [[Koellner2013_UNEPSETACguideline]]).

## Framework for land use inventories and impacts
Currently, habitat loss is modeled in [[life cycle inventory]] through [[land use elementary flows]] ("land transformation" flows and "land occupation" flows). They represent a change in [[ecosystem quality]] over time and space, leading to biodiversity impacts.

These land flows can be [[regionalization|regionalized]], usually at the country level to account for spatial variability.
These flows are classified as [[land use#classification|land use classes]], with possible subclassification of the main classes based on [[land use intensity]].
