**Environmental DNA (eDNA)** refers to [[DNA]] collected in the environment, such as via soil or water samples. This changes from collecting DNA directly from organisms.
# DNA sequencing methods
DNA sequencing refers to the transcription of the nucleotides in the DNA into a code (GATTACA...).
## metagenetics methods
[[DNA metabarcoding#DNA barcoding|DNA barcoding]] is used to identify one species by looking at specific genetic [[marker]] in the DNA sample. Note that it is usually done on an organisms DNA sample, not on environmental DNA.
[[DNA metabarcoding]] is a similar but more advanced, allowing to identify multiple species in a sample.

## metagenomics methods
[[Metagenomics]] is an even more advanced method allowing to identify all (or most) genetic material in a sample, i.e. not just read some key markers but all genes from all DNA sequences available in the sample. This allows the description of an ecosystem's [[microbiome]].

It is used to detect the presence of organisms, living or recently dead due to [[DNA remanence]], and thus detect [[species]] presence to derive local [[compositional diversity]] metrics.

metagenomics vs DNA metabarcoding [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metagenomics)
> The main difference is the underlying methodology, since metagenomics targets all DNA in a sample, while \[barcoding or metabarcoding] amplifies and sequences one or multiple specific genes.
