**Environmental DNA (eDNA)** refers to [[DNA]] collected in the environment, such as via soil or water samples. This changes from collecting DNA directly from organisms.
## eDNA sequencing methods
eDNA is only used because it carries genetic information, which needs to be decoded: this is **DNA sequencing**: the transcription of the chain of nucleotides in the DNA into a code (GATTACA...).
### metagenetics methods
Metagenetics method focus on isolated DNA strands, i.e. groups of genes. 
Decoding DNA at large scale is referred to as [[DNA metabarcoding]].
### metagenomics methods
[[Metagenomics]] is an even more advanced method allowing to identify all (or most) genetic material in a sample, i.e. not just read some key markers but all genes from all DNA sequences available in the sample. This allows the description of an ecosystem's [[microbiome]].

It is used to detect the presence of organisms, living or recently dead due to [[DNA remanence]], and thus detect [[taxonomy]] presence to derive local [[ecological composition]] metrics.

metagenomics vs DNA metabarcoding [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metagenomics)
> The main difference is the underlying methodology, since metagenomics targets all DNA in a sample, while \[barcoding or metabarcoding] amplifies and sequences one or multiple specific genes.

## air sampling
Air sampling can be used and has been found to be very effective for mushrooms.
