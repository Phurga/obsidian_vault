**Ants** are [[eusocial]] [[soil macroarthropod]] (Formicidae) and a major constituent of the [[soil macrofauna]]. They are mainly [[predators]] but can also live domesticate other species to retrieve food from (eg leafcutter ants harvest leafs to farm [[fungus]], sap sucking insects (pucerons)).

Ants are [[ecosystem engineer]], they are abundant and widespread (and their populations might increase with [[climate change]], as the are [[thermophilic]]). They have high a functional diversity and fill a lot of [[biotope|ecological niches]], adapt to a lot of [[ecosystem|ecosystems]].

# Ecological functions
Ants can significantly increase soil [[respiration]], hence CO2 concentrations.

Ants increase decomposition rates of litter, and soil [[carbon transformation]] in general.
Ants are important preys for top predators ([[reptiles]] and [[amphibious]]), being mobile and between soil and surface they are an important link in the [[soil food web]], transfering nutrients.

Ants are a major determinant of [[soil structure]] through their nests and galleries, reducing [[soil compaction]].
