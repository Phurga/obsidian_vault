The equivalent connected area (ECA) is a concept used to consider [[habitat fragmentation]] for species.
It considers the mobility of species and the probability for them to connect different habitat patches (dispersal ability of a species), computing an equivalent contiguous habitat area from a list of isolated habitat patches. This probability is of course species dependent.

It was proposed in [[Saura2011_NetworkAnalysis]].
It is used in [[LCIA method for land use impacts on ecosystem quality]], to account for habitat fragmentation using [[species-area relationship]]s.

Keywords: [[landscape connectivity]], [[functional connectivity]]
