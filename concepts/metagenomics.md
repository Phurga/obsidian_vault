**Metagenomics** is the study of [[environmental DNA]], building a metagenome, a characterization of the [[microbiome]] of an ecosystem. The metagenome is the set of genomes found in an ecosystem, including all species in the microbiome.

A metagenome is built using high throughput [[environmental DNA]]s.
