Transforming an [[ordinal scale]] into a cardinal scale is mathematicaly impossible. Any attempt to do so hides implicit value choices. Even a simple linear transform is a strong assumption. However it is mandatory to do when trying to handle ordinal variables in cardinal models (typically, [[life cycle assessment]]).

Quoting [[Lindner2019_ValuingBiodiversity]]:
> In the original hemeroby literature (for example by Jalas and Sukopp), the hemeroby scale is an ordinal scale, but it is transformed into a cardinal scale here. Fehrenbach et al. used a linear transformation (which we apply here as well), but also discussed an exponential transformation. Brentrup et al. also opted for a linear transformation. **Ultimately, there is no correct way, because the transformation is, in a strict sense, impossible.** Bearing in mind the incompatibility of the ordinal and cardinal scales, transformation is carried out here nevertheless for the sake of practicality. Other proponents of hemeroby in LCIA have also argued for the ordinal-to-cardinal conversion on grounds of practicality.
