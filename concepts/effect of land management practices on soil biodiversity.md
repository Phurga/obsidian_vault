[[soil biodiversity|soil biodiversity]]

Soil work ([[tillage]]) leads to [[soil compaction]] which destroys soil [[soil structure|porosity]], destroying [[biotope|habitat]] to most [[soil biodiversity]] (esp. macrofauna such as [[earthworm]] who are compressed) and leads to soil biodiversity loss.

[[Pollution]] have adverse effects (pests, metals), with [[bioaccumulation]] in larger species so larger species are more affected by pollutions, such as cloportes.

It is possible to study and represent [[food web|trophic chains]] in an ecosystem and assess the response to a perturbation (before after network) [[Hedde2025_Diversityroles]], to be published.

Cultivated ecosystems show more (soil) biodiversity than non cultivated ([[Hedde, Mickael]], [[Labouyrie2023_Patternssoil]]).
