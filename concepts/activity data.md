In [[life cycle assessment]], a system model is created using **activity data**. 
Activity data is said to be foreground (activity) data when this is data associated with the known part of the system (data has been defined/measured). 
Activity data is said to be background when linked to the unknown part of the system. The person performing the study sometimes does not know where some raw materials come from, or where exactly its product will end up. In that case, the system model is defined using data found in databases such as ecoinvent, Agribalyse, the WFLDB or others.
