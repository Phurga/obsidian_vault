**Biodiversity** is the contraction of **biological diversity**: the diversity of life.
# genes, species, ecosystems
Biodiversity is now usually presented as a multi-dimensional concept, going beyond [[species diversity]]. It also includes the [[genetic diversity]] (diversity of genes inside a species population) and [[ecosystem diversity]] (diversity of communities of species).

This is the definition agreed on in the [[convention on biological diversity]]:
[[SecretariatoftheConventiononBiologicalDiversity2011_ConventionBiological]]
> “Biological diversity” means the variability among living organisms from all sources including, inter alia, terrestrial, marine and other aquatic ecosystems and the ecological complexes of which they are part; this includes diversity within species, between species and of ecosystems.

One can also integrate [[landscape diversity]] above ecosystem diversity [[Noss1990_IndicatorsMonitoring]].
# composition, structure, function
Biodiversity is not only [[compositional diversity]] (constituents of the system) but also [[structural diversity]] (interactions in the system) and [[functional diversity]] (functions in the system, such as [[food web|trophic chains]]).

[[Noss1990_IndicatorsMonitoring]] proposes a multi dimensional framework to define the multidimensionality of biodiversity:
> In this paper, I expand the three primay attributes of biodiversity recognized by Jerry Franklin - composition, structure, and  function - into a nested hierarchy that incorporates elements of each attribute at four levels of organization: regional landscape, community-ecosystem, population species, and genetic.

This framework is based on [[Franklin1981_Ecologicalcharacteristics]] who focused on forests, to which structure would make much more common sense (than the expanded meaning for concepts such as genetic structure).
# major realms of life
There are **three major realms** of life:
- terrestrial
- marine
- freshwater
These are the main physical realms, hosting the global biodiversity. 
# biodiversity dynamics
The diversity of biological systems is **dynamic** : its composition, structure and function will change as it is [[main pressures on biodiversity|pressured]] (e.g. human activity, climate change). Biodiverse systems tend to be more resilient, keeping similar function under stress, finding new equilibriums through reorganisation (changes in composition and structure), returning to their original function after stress relief.
Rapid, powerful changes can break the system's ability to find an equilibrium, leading to reduced functionality, or collapse (e.g. desertification). 

An ecosystem's biocenose is continuously changing, even without external (human) interventions. Biodiversity conservation does not consist in halting species extinction, but avoiding causing it.
# nature and biodiversity
The name biodiversity reflects an idea of diversity. However it is usually understood as **nature**.
- **Nature** is all the existing systems created at the same time as the Earth, all the features, forces and processes, such as the weather, the sea and mountains. It is both biotic and abiotic.
- **Biodiversity** is the part of nature that is **alive**, and includes every living thing on Earth. It goes beyond the diversity of species, but includes the diversity of all organisms. Not only for what the organisms are but also for how these organisms are connected with each others and how they function.

# measuring biodiversity
See [[measures of biodiversity]]
[[Biomass]] is also a measure of biota, but not a direct measure of diversity (although indirectly since increased number and mass of organisms leads to increase of genes, species and ecosystems).
