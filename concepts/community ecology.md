**Community ecology** is the study of patterns in the diversity, abundance, and composition of species in communities, and of the processes underlying these patterns.
## processes
According to [[Vellend2010_ConceptualSynthesis]], there are four classes of processes explaining biodiversity patterns:
- _selection_, represents deterministic fitness differences among species ([[niche theory]]),
- _drift_, represents [[stochastic]] changes in species abundance,
- [[speciation]], creates new species, and
- _dispersal_, is the movement of organisms across space ([[migration]], [[ecological connectivity]]).

These four processes are analogous to the four main process in [[evolutionary biology]] and are considered an extension of the concept of [[ecological filtering]].
## patterns
Patterns tend not to be explained by community ecology theory, but the main processes should be enough to explain these although not all the causal chain is known.

[[Vellend2010_ConceptualSynthesis]] provides a list of patterns, including:

[[occupancy-abundance relationship]]
[[species-area relationship]]
[[food web]]
[[beta diversity]] (changes under an environmental gradient)
## previous theories
Multiple unifying theories, relying on a list of assumptions [[Vellend2010_ConceptualSynthesis]] proposes a comparison:

## soils community ecology
Some authors propose theories on soil spatial patterns which are currently misunderstood:

[[Calderon-Sanou2022_betterunderstanding]] tests few patterns:
