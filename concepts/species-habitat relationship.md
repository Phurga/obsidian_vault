 The **species-habitat-relationship** is a refinement of the [[countryside SAR]] approach, proposed in [[Kuipers2021_ConsideringHabitat]]. 

This model considers habitat [[habitat fragmentation]], ie the potential species richness in two patches of 1 m2 is less than in one patch of 2 m2, using the "[[equivalent connected area]]".

The SAR becomes: $S = c.(ECA.h)^z$. 

Used in LCA where defined [[Kuipers2021_ConsideringHabitat]], and further in [[Scherer2023_BiodiversityImpact]].
