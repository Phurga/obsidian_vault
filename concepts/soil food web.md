The soil [[food web]] is a simplified model representing the relations between [[soil biodiversity|soil species]] through throphic chains.

In this model, organisms can be grouped by [[taxonomy|species]] but since species definitions are challenging for microorganisms, organisms can also be grouped by taxon (clades) and by trophic groups. It is usual to classify by functional roles too.
## functional roles of soil organisms
In this model, several classes are defined related to the function of species in the soil:
1. [[autotroph|Primary producers]]are plants, and plant biomass is accessed through roots, but also some algae and bacteria. Plants produce sugar for their own direct function, but also send a portion of this energetic molecules as [[exudates]] through their roots to attract microorganisms for [[symbiotic]] processes.
2. The [[microfood web]], composed of [[microorganism]] (bacteria, fungi), decompose these exudates and store nutrients in the [[rhizosphere]]. [[microfauna]] (protozoa and nematodes) feeds of these microorganisms.
3. [[litter transformer]], composed of [[soil mesofauna]] (microarthropods), breaking down litter into smaller parts, increasing active surface for microorganisms activity and enabling the microfood web.
4. [[ecosystem engineer]], composed of [[soil macrofauna]] (eg worms, macroarthropods) and [[megafauna]] (eg mammals) modify [[soil structure]] at larger scale by moving through the soil, creating habitat for litter transformers.
5. Other predatory arthropods feed of the micro and mesofauna, with increased mobility, favouring the cycling and spreading of energy and nutrients.

[[FAO2020_Stateknowledge]]:
> The contributions of soil organisms can be grouped into three broad categories (Figure 1). 
> - First, soil microorganisms (i.e., bacteria, fungi) and microfauna (i.e., protozoa and nematodes) transform organic and inorganic compounds into accessible forms as part of their metabolism through extraordinarily complex biochemical processes. These transformations are critical for ecosystem services such as nutrient availability for the growth of plants and other organisms, soil organic matter and nutrient cycling, and the filtration, degradation and immobilization of contaminants in water and soil.
> - Second, soil organisms are part of a vast food web that cycles energy and nutrients from microscopic forms through the soilâ€™s megafauna to organisms that live on top of the soil. An important part of the food web is represented by mesofauna such as springtails and mites, which accelerate litter decomposition and enhance nutrient cycling and availability (especially nitrogen), and predate on smaller soil organisms (Figure 1). 
> - Finally, soil macrofauna and megafauna such as earthworms, ants, termites and some mammals act as ecosystem engineers that modify soil porosity, water and gas transport, and also bind together soil particles into stable aggregates that hold the soil in place, reducing soil erosion (Figure 1).
