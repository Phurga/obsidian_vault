The soil [[food web]] is a simplified model representing the trophic relationships between [[soil biodiversity|soil organisms]].

In this model, organisms can be grouped by [[taxonomy|species]] but since species definitions are challenging for microorganisms, organisms can also be grouped by functional roles, by taxon (clades) and by trophic groups, as is done in [[FAO2020_Stateknowledge]].
## functional roles
In this model, several classes are defined related to the function of species in the soil:
1. [[autotroph|primary producers]] are plants, and plant biomass is accessed through roots, but also some algae and bacteria. Plants produce sugar for their own direct function, but also send a portion of this energetic molecules as exudates through their roots to attract microorganisms for [[symbiosis|symbiotic relationship]]s.
2. The **microfood web**, composed of [[microorganism]] (bacteria, fungi), decompose these exudates and store nutrients in the [[rhizosphere]]. [[microfauna]] (protozoa and nematodes) feeds of these microorganisms.
3. [[litter transformer]], composed of [[soil mesofauna]] (microarthropods), breaking down litter into smaller parts, increasing active surface for microorganisms activity and enabling the microfood web.
4. [[ecosystem engineer]], composed of [[soil macrofauna]] (eg worms, macroarthropods) and [[megafauna]] (eg mammals) modify [[soil structure]] at larger scale by moving through the soil, creating habitat for litter transformers.
5. Other [[predation]]y arthropods feed of the micro and mesofauna, with increased mobility, favouring the cycling and spreading of energy and nutrients.

## channels
The concept of **channels** is related to flows of energy, supposedly following a "path", from the first heterotrophs to higher trophic levels. This seems to be challenged:![[Calderon-Sanou2022_betterunderstanding#^daeced]]

## soil multi-trophic classification
[[Calderon-Sanou2022_betterunderstanding]] combines high level taxonomic classification with trophic groups to obtain a soil multi-trophic classification shown below:

This classification was used in [[Cerna2025_Limitspromises]], based on the work done in [[Hedde2022_commonframework]].
