The soil [[food web]] is a simplified model representing the relations between [[soil biodiversity|soil species]] through throphic chains.

In this model, organisms can be grouped by [[taxonomy|species]] but since species definitions are challenging for microorganisms, organisms can also be grouped by taxon (clades) and by trophic groups. It is usual to classify by functional roles too.
## functional roles of soil organisms
In this model, several classes are defined related to the function of species in the soil:
1. [[autotroph|Primary producers]]are plants, and plant biomass is accessed through roots, but also some algae and bacteria. Plants produce sugar for their own direct function, but also send a portion of this energetic molecules as [[exudates]] through their roots to attract microorganisms for [[symbiotic]] processes.
2. The [[microfood web]], composed of [[microorganism]] (bacteria, fungi), decompose these exudates and store nutrients in the [[rhizosphere]]. [[microfauna]] (protozoa and nematodes) feeds of these microorganisms.
3. [[litter transformer]], composed of [[soil mesofauna]] (microarthropods), breaking down litter into smaller parts, increasing active surface for microorganisms activity and enabling the microfood web.
4. [[ecosystem engineer]], composed of [[soil macrofauna]] (eg worms, macroarthropods) and [[megafauna]] (eg mammals) modify [[soil structure]] at larger scale by moving through the soil, creating habitat for litter transformers.
5. Other predatory arthropods feed of the micro and mesofauna, with increased mobility, favouring the cycling and spreading of energy and nutrients.

## channels
The concept of **channels** is related to flows of energy, supposedly following a "path", from the first heterotrophs to higher trophic levels. This seems to be challenged:![[CalderonSanou2022_betterunderstanding#^daeced]]
