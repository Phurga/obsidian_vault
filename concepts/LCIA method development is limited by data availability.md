There is currently no consensual [[endpoint]] indicator to consider impacts on [[biodiversity]] in the LCA community. The multidimensionality of biodiversity leads to a diversity of approach, considering different aspects of biodiversity ([[Damiani2023_CriticalReview]]). However many methods agree to use [[species richness]] as a proxy for biodiversity, [[Scherer2023_BiodiversityImpact]] being the most advanced method, and the one recommended in the [[GLAM]].
