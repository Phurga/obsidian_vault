The **planetary boundaries** is a concept developped in 2009  [[Rockstrom2009_SafeOperating]] and updated in 2023 in [[Richardson2023_EarthSix]] (also in 2015 [[Steffen2015_PlanetaryBoundaries]]).

The approach establishes nine environmental impact categories with associated boundaries ([[tipping points]]), considering that surpassing these limits will lead to unknown adverse consequences (outside of a safe operating space).
Some limits are physicochemical limits are quite robust, but some others are challenged, especially biodiversity ( [[Montoya2018_PlanetaryBoundaries]], [brook](https://www.cell.com/trends/ecology-evolution/fulltext/S0169-5347(13)00033-5?large_figure=true), [[Mace2014_ApproachesDefining]]).
In the latest 2023 update, [[biodiversity]] was measured with two dimensions: [[genetic diversity]] (via a [[species extinction risk|species extinction]] rate) and [[functional integrity]] (via a [[HANPP]])

[[Biermann2020_BoundariesPlanetary]] critique of planetary boundaries.

An especially violent attack for biodiversity boundaries: [[Montoya2018_PlanetaryBoundaries]]
> First, there is an acute moral hazard \[in promoting a boundary framework involving tipping points for biodiversity]. Because there is no operational definition of ‘safe operating space’, this not only encourages arguments that ‘growth within limits’[i](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016953471730263X#sec0025) is acceptable but also the belief that human actions were once environmentally either benign or allowed recovery. Worse still, if the planet is not obviously collapsing around us, then surely we can continue to deplete it.
> Second, if we suggest that a catastrophe has taken place and the consequences are not evident, then how will managers and policy makers trust the science we do? When bad science informs policies, its future credibility is compromised.
> Third, the planetary boundary framework suggests that we can view nature and its complex ecological processes as a type of black box – if we do not poke it too hard, we will not need to understand its details. We need not define measures, terms, processes, responses in operational ways. In short, ecological ignorance is bliss, if human actions remain within limits.
> Reality is different. Nothing changed globally in 1989, and this local experience has many precedents elsewhere, before and after. This cod collapse was unfortunate, but overfishing is global, as appreciated since the 18th century, and the term was first used (for cod) in 1855. Humans overfished, overharvested, overgrazed, deforested, polluted, and caused many other environmental ills long before 1989 and in many other places. They have exterminated substantial numbers of species globally, and especially top predators, across vast swaths of land and sea, and have done so for tens of thousands of years.
