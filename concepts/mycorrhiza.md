A **mycorrhiza** is a mutualist [[symbiosis|symbiotic relationship]] between a [[plant]] and a [[fungus]] in the [[rhizosphere]] (constituting a **mycorrhizosphere**). The fungi will primarily allow for increased soil exploration, increase soil structure and water retention, provide water and nutrient (especially [[phosphorus]]) to the plant. The plant can refuse the mycorrhize if they do not need it.

Fungi (and generally microorgs) are very widespread on earth. But still soy (from Asia) would not create nodules (symbiosis with bacteria) in South America before the bacteria was inoculated.
# endo and ecto mycorrhiza
Mycorrhizas can be **endomycorrhizes** (*inside* the root tissue) or **ectomycorrhize** (*outside* the root tissue).

Endomycorrhizial fungi cannot survive without the plant : they remain dormant as spores in the soil, are moved around by the [[microfauna]] as moves in soil until the spore gets in contact with a root.

Endomycorrhize are not inside the cell membrane: they go inside the tissue barrier but push the cell membrane into an *arbuscule* shape to increase contact area and favour chemical exchanges. Endomycorrhizes are also named **arbuscural mycorrhizal fungi (AMF)**.

# mycellium
Fungi spread in soils with **hyphea**, constituting a network of **mycelium**. Mycelium is microscopic and thus invisible to they eye, except when bundled in packets, white small roots.

One tree can have more than 300 species of fungi performing a mychorize on them ([[Hinsinger2025_RhizosphereRoots]]).

Root hairs give 1 mm of root lenght while mychorize give 10 cm more  ([[Hinsinger2025_RhizosphereRoots]]).

Ectomychorize do not collect P and H2O #todo/notsure 
# effect on plants
We currently do not have clear conclusions on quantified benefits of mycorrhizes on plants, maybe they have strong effects (esp in stressing conditions) but maybe they do not really have effects. This is because we do not know how to isolate the effect of the mycorrhize ([[Hinsinger2025_RhizosphereRoots]]).
