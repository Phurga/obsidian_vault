The **Shannon index** is an indicator of [[ecological composition]], measuring species [[functional eveness|eveness]]. This measure accounts for richness and abundance, and reaches a maximum value when all species occur equally abundant.

$H = - \sum{p_k*ln p_k}$ 
where $p_k$ is the number of organisms of species $k$ relative to the total number of organisms $N$ across all species ($p_k=\frac{N_k}{\sum_k{N_k}}$.

Shannon index reaches 1 where all species are present in equal abundance, and 0 when ??
