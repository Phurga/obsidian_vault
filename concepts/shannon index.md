The **Shannon index** is an indicator of [[ecological composition]]. This measure accounts for richness and abundance, and reaches a maximum value when all species occur equally abundant ([[species eveness]]).

Formula from [[DeBaan2013_Landuse]]
$H = - \sum{p_k*ln p_k}$ 
where $p_k$ is the number of organisms of species $k$ relative to the total number of organisms across all species ($p_k=\frac{N_k$.
