**Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)** is a molecule storing genetic information in organisms cells.

DNA is made of chains of nucleotides, thus DNA is a nucleic acid polymer.

DNA is a [[DNA remanence|remanent]] molecule in soils (making it a stable source of phosphorus).

[[microorganism]] are difficult to study, and [[environmental DNA]] based approach can enable large scall microorganisms population detection and identification. However knowing the DNA of an organism does not provide direct information on the organism functions.
