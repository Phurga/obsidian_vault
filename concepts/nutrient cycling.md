**Nutrient cycling** is one of the key [[soil function]]s.

The main nutrients are [[nitrogen]] and [[phosphorus]]. One can also account for [[potassium]] and sometimes [[sulfur]], and [[oxygen]]. They are present in limiting concentrations in soil and organisms tend to compete (or at least spend lots of energy) to find these ressources. 

Unlike carbon, nutrients are not lost by the ecosystem through respiration, but are commonly excreted in liquid and solid form through detritus. Healthy soil functioning, through biological activity, and especially via the [[microbial loop]], allows favours cycling back nutrients stored in organic compounds into mineral compounds, and thus increased availability to more organisms, a virtuous cycle.
## chemistry
These nutrients can occur under an organic form or a mineral form.

Plants use the mineral form - transforming it to an organic form. For instance for nitrogen, this is [[ammonia]] or [[nitrate]].

[[Microorganism]]s use the organic form and can convert it to a mineral form, this is known as the [[microbial loop]]. 
[[bacteria]] can transform N2 into [[ammonia]]. [[fungus]] can solubilize rock phosphorus in to [[phosphate]].

[[DNA]] is a stable phosphorus rich, compound (but there is little DNA per organism) and thus an important P sink. Proteins are rich in nitrogen.

Organisms have a defined [[C to N ratio]], and they tend to look for food that correspond to this ratio. They need to expulse excess nutrients in their excretions to maintain their C to N ratio. This means that organisms eating too rich food will produce rich excrements, food for other organisms. [[earthworms]] turricles are for instance richer than the rest of the soil.

Example of nitrogen cycling: (N2 > NH3 > NO2 > NO3 > Norg cycle) [[Marsden2025_Introductionsoil]]
Example of phosphorus cycling: (P rock > HPO4 > phytate > Porg) phytate: P storing molecule for plants (in grain)
## biological stimulation
[[microfauna]] can stimulate the cycling of these nutrients via predation (e.g. [[nematodes]] can increase a lot nutrient availability in soil via their activity).
There are important concentrations of nutrients in soils, but it is not always available to organisms. Eg for plants, phosphate is not mobile and is only absorbed at the surrounding of roots, leading to important exploration strategies for roots.
