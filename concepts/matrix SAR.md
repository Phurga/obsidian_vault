The **Matrix-Calibrated Speciesâ€“Area Relationship** is a refinement of the original [[species-area-relationship|SAR]] model defined in [[Koh2010_MatrixCalibratedSpeciesArea]]. 

The model considers that human modified [[habitat]], i.e. [[land use#classification|land use classes]], can be a suitable habitat for wild species, although [[species distribution model|suboptimal]].

This model considers only species variability in sensitivity of area loss, and does not consider a linear change in sensitivity. Contrary to the [[countryside SAR|cSAR]] approach, affinity is considered inside the z factor. 

[[It is still debated what approach is most accurate to model species-habitat affinities]]

Used in LCA in [[DeBaan2013_LandUsea]].
