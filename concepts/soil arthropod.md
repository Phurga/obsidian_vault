There are a lot of **arthropods in soils**, with a large variety of functions in the [[ecosystem]]s.
**Arthropods** have a chitin exosqueleton and a body with paired segments. They can have many pods (hexapods including insects, arachnids including [[mite]], milipods etc). Arthropods are [[invertebrate]].

We can distinguish [[soil microarthropod]] and [[soil macroarthropod]] based on relative size. From 0.1mm to 2mm: microarthropods, from 2mm to 5cm: macroarthropods. The first will tend to be detritivores while the latter tend to be predators.

[[tardigrade]] are close to arthropods but are not classified as arthropods. I believe it is ok to ignore them although they are very cute and might be useful to ecosystems, or at least put them with arthropods.
