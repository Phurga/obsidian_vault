Some authors mention an intrinsic value of nature, that would not be affected by human considerations and utilitarian aspects. Valuing nature for what it is, rather than for what it provides us, would be a goal in "pure" study of biodiversity.

>[! Discussion with Arnaud, personal interpretation]
There is a materialistic "use value" of nature, which we want to capture and measure through ecosystem services. The debate surrounding the qualification of an "intrinsic value" is maybe a semantic debate. Economists do not conceptualize "intrinsic value" since value is per definition given by humans, hence always in relation to us (not intrinsic). Ecologists want to describe nature functioning as a process beyond human influence or interest, and behind this "absolute" quantification a will to quantify degradations, especially anthropogenic ones, disturbing this functioning. This quantification should use an indicator that does not reflect human use or human perceived qualities but a neutral description of an ecological state.
