It is debatted whereas **nature has intrinsic value**. This is a question related to [[environmental ethics]]: considering an [[environmental ethics|intrinsic value]] of nature involves a [[environmental ethics|non-anthropocentric]] moral.

There are three school of thought:
- the subjectivist vision, considering that this intrinsic value is given by human (anthropogenic), but is independent of human activity (not anthropocentric). However it is acknowledged that this intrinsic value is cultural and depends on who values it.
- the objectivist vision of intrinsic considers a value "established beyond both individual judgments and cultural ideals" ([[Kantian ethics]]), supported by [[Ness, Arne]] (deep ecology).
- the vision that there is no intrinsic value,

## existence of an intrinsic value of species
### from conservation biology
The intrinsic value of species is a postulate of [[conservation biology]]: ![[Soule1985_WhatConservation#intrinsic value of species is a normative postulate in conservation biology]]
### a religious or sacred view of nature
[FAO](https://www.fao.org/agriculture/crops/thematic-sitemap/theme/compendium/tools-guidelines/how-to-conserve-soil-biodiversity/en/)
> Regardless of any ecological or monetary value, several authors (Hågvar, 1994; McNeely et al., 1995) have stressed ethical and moral reasons why biodiversity should be conserved.  Most of the world’s religions give intrinsic worth to the natural world, and it is unlikely that this deep-seated notion will disappear, even despite the force of the economic use values placed on biodiversity. However, the world view that denies any sacred value or self-worth to nature is being rapidly spread throughout the world by globalization and modern industrial societies who view the world as a warehouse of commodities for human enjoyment. The danger of this to biodiversity conservation should not be underestimated, although the possibility of using biodiversity for enjoyment (e.g. ecotourism) and other benefits may serve to counteract the negative forces of ecologically ignorant consumer societies.
## quantification of the intrinsic value of nature
Besides acknowleding the existence of intrinsic value or of the intrinsic value of nature, an additional challenges arises when one is tempted to *quantify* this value.

>whereas there is really intrinsic value or not, what matter is that people are trying to characterize impacts on nature beyond its instrumental value for human
