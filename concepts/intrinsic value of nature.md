It is debatted whereas **nature has intrinsic value**. This is a question related to [[environmental ethics]]: considering an [[environmental ethics|intrinsic value]] of nature involves a [[environmental ethics|non-anthropocentric]] moral.
objectivist vision: value in nature especially in species due to heritage in evolutionary process (natural historical value) or inherent value
subjectivist vision: anthropogenic value although not anthropocentric

There are three school of thought:
- the subjectivist vision, considering that this intrinsic value is given by human, but is independent of human activity (inherent value). However it is acknowledged that this intrinsic value is cultural and depends on who values it.
- the objectivist vision of intrinsic considers a value "established beyond both individual judgments and cultural ideals" ([[Kantian ethics]]), supported by [[Ness, Arne]] (deep ecology).
- the vision that there is no intrinsic value,

## intrinsic value of species
The intrinsic value of species is a postulate of [[conservation biology]]: ![[Soule1985_WhatConservation#^50ef53]]
This consideration is debated. While intrinsic value of organisms is generally accepted, species and natural-historical valueing can be challenged.

## quantification of the intrinsic value of nature
Besides acknowleding the existence of intrinsic value or of the intrinsic value of nature, an additional challenges arises when one is tempted to *quantify* this value.

>[!warning] opinion
> I cannot conceptualize intrinsic value of things, assuming that nature has a value beyond our relationship with it (i.e. we give it value). For nature, I believe that the intrinsic value of nature is only beyond materialistic valuing of nature, a mixture of cultural and spiritual value.


>[! Discussion with Arnaud, personal interpretation]
There is a materialistic "use value" of nature, which we want to capture and measure through ecosystem services. The debate surrounding the qualification of an "intrinsic value" is maybe a semantic debate. Economists do not conceptualize "intrinsic value" since value is per definition given by humans, hence always in relation to us (not intrinsic). Ecologists want to describe nature functioning as a process beyond human influence or interest, and behind this "absolute" quantification a will to quantify degradations, especially anthropogenic ones, disturbing this functioning. This quantification should use an indicator that does not reflect human use or human perceived qualities but a neutral description of an ecological state.

>[!warning] don't forget
>whereas there is really intrinsic value or not, what matter is that people are trying to characterize impacts on nature beyond its instrumental value for human
