We can count three facets for species diversity:
- [[taxonomy|taxonomic]] (hierarchical classification of organisms)
- [[functional diversity]] (ecological functions of organisms)
- [[phylogenetic diversity]] (evolutionary relationships of organisms)

Note that modern taxonomy is based on phylogeny, making the two quite close. However, taxonomy focuses on classifying species, sometimes using morphological traits beyond phylogenetic information.
