**Species extinction risk** characterize the risk for a [[taxonomy]] to go extinct, usually via population dynamics, or indirectly via habitat dynamics.

Species extinction risk increases as a species is endemic (limited geographical range) and vulnerable (natural habitat range is decreasing).
Accounting for this extinction risk is important to convert local [[relative species loss]] into global species extinction risk.

In [[UNEP2019_GlobalGuidance]], they propose 3 key concepts about vulnerability, of which the 2 last are missing in LCIA:
- sensitivity (of species, to pressure)
- adaptive capacity (of species, under pressure)
- recovery potential (of species, after pressure)

# Indicators in LCA
Latest recommended by the [[GLAM]]: [[global extinction probability]]. 
Former indicator: [[vulnerability score]].

# Data sources
The [[IUCN red ist of threatened species]] is an important database to monitor species extinction risk.
