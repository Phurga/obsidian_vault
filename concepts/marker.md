In DNA sequencing, a **marker** is a gene or group of [[genes]] used to identify a [[species]].

Markers are used in [[DNA metabarcoding]]. Different [[taxon]] are associated with different markers. 

Below is a list of usual markers: 

| taxon             | marker                                             |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| [[bacteria]]      | [[16S rRNA]]                                       |
| [[fungus]]         | [[18s rRNA]], [[ITS]]                              |
| animals, protists | [[COX1]]                                           |
| plants            | no universal marker ([[Letsiou2024_DNABarcoding]]) |
