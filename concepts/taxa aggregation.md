In [[LCIA method for land use impacts on ecosystem quality]], impact is calculated by comparing species count in a reference state and under a given land use class. Since different taxon are counted differently, one will observe measurement biases and it makes more sense to calculate taxon specific species loss. Doing so involves calculating a **taxon aggregated result**. This aggregation is not straightforward.

This question is discussed in [[Verones2015_HarmonizingAssessment]].

In [[Chaudhary2015_QuantifyingLand]], aggregation is done considering equal weights for each taxon (considering 5 taxon for regional CFs ([[tetrapod]]) and 4 taxon for global CFs (adding [[plants]]).

In [[Verones2020_LCIMPACTRegionalized]], aggregation is done considering 50% of the weight for [[tetrapod]] (with equal weighting for the 4 subclasses) and 50% for plants.
