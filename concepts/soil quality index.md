The **soil quality index (SQI)** is a [[LCA]] to account for [[soil quality]].

It is defined in [[DeLaurentiis2019_Soilquality]], building on the previous method [[LANCA]].
The main outcomes are :
- identifying a 1 to 1 correlation between physicochemical filtration and mechanical filtration, leading to a shortlisting of now 4 indicators (removing PF),
- a new normalization procedure to scale each indice between 0 and 100 (avoiding negative results which challenges interpretation),
- a new aggregation procedure to obtain a single index from the four soil indices at country level, adding a normalization factor based on national inventories
