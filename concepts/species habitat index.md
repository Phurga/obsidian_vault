The **species habitat index (SHI)** is a measure of the potential habitat for a given species, as a function of the extent of habitat-suitable area (relative to a historical reference) and the connectivity of this area.

Defined mainly in [[CBDandUNEP2021_IndicatorMetadata]], but see also [this link](https://mapoflife.ai/resources/indicators/species-habitat-index) referring to [[Hansen2021_MonitoringForest]] and [Powers and Jetz 2019](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-019-0406-z).

Values can be viewed on the [map of life website](https://mol.org/indicators/habitat/regions).
### method details
The value is calculated by the [[GEO BON]] (i.e. the [[CBD]] ) for vascular plants and vertebrates. 

The SHI is calculated "using local biodiversity observations (as available in the GBIF) and remotely sensed habitat characterization (i.e. [[species distribution model]]s)".
### uses
SHI is used as a measure of [[ecosystem integrity]] and is recommended by the [[CBD]].
