The **species habitat index (SHI)** is a measure of the potential habitat for a given species, as a function of the extent of habitat-suitable area (relative to a historical reference) and the connectivity of this area.

The value is calculated by the [[GEO BON]] (i.e. the [[CBD]] ) for vascular plants and vertebrates. 

The SHI is calculated "using local biodiversity observations (as available in the GBIF) and remotely sensed habitat characterization (i.e. [[species distribution model]]s)".
### uses
SHI is used as a measure of [[ecosystem integrity]].
