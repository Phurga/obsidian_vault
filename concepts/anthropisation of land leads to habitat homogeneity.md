Human use land as a resource and modify the natural environment to increase the value of this resource. These modications lead to the destruction of some [[biotope|ecological niches]], and the creation of others. There is usually a net destruction of niches since human favour specialisation, hence homogeneisation of the environment.

Through landscape homogeneisation, there is species composition homogeneisation, but not always loss of species. In other terms, human activities favour not only homogeneisation of landscapes but also mobility of species, leading to potential increased local richness measures ([[alpha diversity]]) but will generally decrease regional richness measures ([[gamma diversity]]).

Example with [[earthworms]] in France: local taxonomic richness of earthworms has increased ([[Hedde2025_Diversityroles]]).
