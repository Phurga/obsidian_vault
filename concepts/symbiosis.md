**Symbiosis** stands for long term **biological interactions**, which do not have to be mutually beneficial. Mutually beneficial interactions is named [[mutualism]]. An organism living in symbiosis is a **symbiont (or symbiote)**.

There are short term interactions:
- predation ([[food web|trophic chain]], a [[predator]] kills a [[prey]]).
- [[pollination]] (exchange of nectar for seed dispersal, hence a mutualist interaction).
- and also seed dispersal in general)
- competition for space
- habitat modification ([[ecosystem engineer]])

[[commensalism]]
[[mutualism]]
[[parasitism]]
[[neutralism]]
