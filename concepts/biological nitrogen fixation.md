**Biological nitrogen fixation** occurs in some prokaryotes (mainly [[bacteria]]) that have the capacity to convert atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia in a process called **nitrogenase**.

This process is energy intensive, requiring energy in the form of [[ATP]]. ATP molecules require [[phosphorus]], thus nitrogenase requires phosphorus availability, and can be P-limited. 

Microorganisms can enter [[symbiosis|symbiotic relationship]]s with plants, using plant's energy to perform the nitrogenase in exchange for ammonia stored in nodules ([[rhizobacteria]] and [[Azospirillum]]), use photosynthesis ([[cyanobacteria]]) or oxidize surrounding organic molecules ([[azotobacter]]).

Bacteria fixing: [[rhizobacteria]] (legumes), [[azotobacter]] (free living), [[Azospirillum]] (grasses/cereals), [[cyanobacteria]] (autotroph)

# Conversion of ammonia to nitrate
[[archae]] can convert ammonia into nitrate, leading to even greater biomass production by plants. [ref](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17048140/), [[FAO2020_Stateknowledge]]
