**Viruses** are DNA packets inside a protein coat, sometimes contained within a lipid coat (about 10 to 100nm large). Virus ecology is poorly known for now.

Viruses mostly kill or slow down their hosts. It is assumed that some organisms eat viruses. 

In marine ecosystems, viruses kill 20 to 40% of local [[microorganism|microbes]] daily, leading to important [[carbon transformation]], [[nutrient cycling]] and [[biological regulation]] functions. There are up to $10^{10}$ viruses per gram of soil, maybe more given that some times of viruses might not be detected with current methods, so it is assumed viruses play similar important roles in soils ecology at microbial scales. But this role is still unknown.

It is not clear if viruses are [[organism]]s ([[Moreira2009_TenReasons]]), but if they do, they would most likely then represent nearly all existing species due to their great DNA diversity ([[Anthony2023_EnumeratingSoil]]).

Viruses are important in [[biological regulation]] and [[nutrient cycling]]. For instance, a virus infects a [[bacteria]] and subsequently infects a colony of bacteria, then the viruses trigger a [[lysis]], releasing all the nitrogen content of bacteria in the environment. This leads to a patch of [[necromass]], which is a nutrient hotspot and enables carbon cycling.
