Used by [[Lindner2019_ValuingBiodiversity]] and [[Lindner2021_MovingLand]] to account for [[threshold effect]] in [[life cycle assessment]].
The main principle is to apply logic operations (combination of inputs using AND OR etc) on continous variables (y=f(x) instead of 0 and 1). This allows new ways of integrating categories with soft limits, or uncertainties.
