The name biodiversity reflects an idea of diversity. However it is usually understood as **nature**.
- **Nature** is all the existing systems created at the same time as the Earth, all the features, forces and processes, such as the weather, the sea and mountains. It is both biotic and abiotic.
- **Biodiversity** is the part of nature that is **alive**, and includes every living thing on Earth. It goes beyond the diversity of species, but includes the diversity of all organisms. Not only for what the organisms are but also for how these organisms are connected with each others and how they function.
