A species is considered **extinct** when the last individual of this [[species]] disappears.

One should differentiate **local extinction**, which can correspond to  eliminated in a region, or [[migration|migrates]] from a region, we say that the species is locally extinct.
If this region was the last region where the species occured, the species is [[globally extinct]], see [[species extinction risk]].
