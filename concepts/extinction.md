A species is considered **extinct** when the last individual of this [[taxonomy]] disappears.

One should differentiate:
- **local extinction**, which can correspond to a species going extinct in a region, because it dies or [[migration|migrated]] elsewhere, and
- **global extinction** (or true extinction) when a species goes extinct in the last region where it occured. Global exinction is more critical than local extinction, and [[species extinction risk]] can be quantified.
