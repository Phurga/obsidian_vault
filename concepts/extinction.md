A species is considered **extinct** when the last individual of this [[taxonomy]] disappears.

One should differentiate:
- **local extinction**, which can correspond to a species going extinct in a region, because it dies or [[migration|migrated]] elsewhere, and
- **global extinction** (or true extinction) when a species goes extinct in the last region where it occured. Global exinction is more critical than local extinction, and [[species extinction risk]] can be quantified.
## microbial extinction
### local extinction
The concept of extinction is unclear for [[microorganism|microbes]] and especially prokaryotes. Local extinction is in most cases a reduction of the population below detection limits. See [[endospore]].
### global extinction
Global extinction is unlikely given how widespread microrganisms are: extinction is tied to habitat extinction and there is no miminal habitat size ([[Weinbauer2007_ExtinctionMicrobes]]).

### loss of ecosystem function
More important than microbial species extinction is the loss of ecosystem function relying on microbes. In the ecosystem, microbes are combinations of functions, and while there are redundancies in functions among microbial species, some ecosystem functions can rely on unique combinations found in specific organisms([[Weinbauer2007_ExtinctionMicrobes]]).
### eradication
Eventually, extinction could happen when there is a will to eradicate microbial pathogens such as some viruses [[Weinbauer2007_ExtinctionMicrobes]]).
