One aspect of a [[biodiversity]] is **ecological composition**. It relates to the list of organisms composing the ecosystem, and is studied in [[community ecology]].
## ecological community of an ecosystem
The **ecological community** is the ensemble of organisms constituting an ecosystem. This ensemble is also called the **biocenosis**, the **life assemblage** and similar names (e.g. biotic community, biological community...)

The ecological community is a qualitative concept, linked to the ecosystem indentity, but is measured (projection) via indicators such as [[species richness]] and [[species abudance]], see [[measures of biodiversity#indicators]].
## other compositional aspects
Landscapes are composed of ecosystems.
Organisms are composed of genes.
