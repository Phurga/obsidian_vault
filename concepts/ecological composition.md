One aspect of a [[biodiversity]] is **ecological composition**. It relates to the list of elements composing the system.

[[Noss1990_IndicatorsMonitoring]]
> Composition has to do with the identity and variety of elements in a collection, and includes species lists and measures of species diversity and genetic diversity. 
## ecological community of an ecosystem
The **ecological community** is the ensemble of organisms constituting an ecosystem. This ensemble is also called the **biocenosis**, the **life assemblage** and similar names (e.g. biotic community, biological community...)

The ecological community is a qualitative concept, linked to the ecosystem indentity, but is measured (projection) via indicators such as [[species richness]] and [[species abudance]], see [[measures of biodiversity#indicators]]. Species composition was also found to be a good proxy for ecosystem functioning #todo/refneeded 
## other compositional aspects
Landscapes are composed of ecosystems.
Organisms are composed of genes.
