One aspect of a biodiverse system is its **ecological composition**. It relates to the list of elements composing the system.

[[Noss1990_IndicatorsMonitoring]]
> Composition has to do with the identity and variety of elements in a collection, and includes species lists and measures of species diversity and genetic diversity. 
## ecological community of an ecosystem
The **ecological community** is the ensemble of organisms constituting an ecosystem. It is also called **biocenosis**, **life assemblage** and similar names (e.g. biotic community, biological community, life community and same with assemblage).

The ecological community is usually characterized by species composition, and measured via indicators such as [[species richness]] and [[species abudance]], see [[measures of biodiversity#indicators]].
Species composition was also found to be a good proxy for ecosystem functioning #todo/refneeded 
## other compositional aspects
Landscapes are composed of ecosystems.
Organisms are composed of genes.
