**Land use intensity** refers to the intensity of [[land management]] practices.

For instance, intensive land management practice for agriculture include monoculture with frequent and deep tillage, significant mineral fertilization and pesticide usage. Intensive forestry would refer to monocultures with clear cutting and eventual fertilization or irrigation.
## classification
It is known that more intense land management practices have more impacts on the enviroment. Land use classes are thus subclassified based on intensity levels, generally:
- minimal use,
- light use,
- intense use. 

There are some classification of land use intensities, as proposed by [[Hudson2014_PREDICTSdatabase]] (used by [[Scherer2023_BiodiversityImpact]])

## land perturbation gradient
In [[Labouyrie2023_Patternssoil]], there is mention of a **land perturbation gradient** which mixes different land use classes and orders those based on "land use perturbation". There is no supporting evidence for this ordering (how are grasslands more perturbed than forests).

## quantifying land use intensity
[[Bloor2021_AnalysisComplex]] uses a quantification of land use intensity based on an index from [[Bluthgen2012_QuantitativeIndex]].
See [[Bloor2021_AnalysisComplex#quantification of land use intensity]].
## data sources
#data 
data sources for land use intensity data:
- [[Chaudhary2018_LandUse]] uses [[vanAsselen2013_Landcover]] (spatial explicit, global coverage, 2000) and [[Arets2011_GlobalWood]] (country level, global, 2008)
- [[Orgiazzi2016_knowledgebasedapproach]] uses [[Temme2011_Mappingmodelling]] (spatial explicit, europe, 2000)
- [[Scherer2023_BiodiversityImpact]] uses [[Winkler2021_Globalland]] (spatial explicit, global, 2015) and [[PREDICTS]] ([[Hudson2017_databasePREDICTS]]).
