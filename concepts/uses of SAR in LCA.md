[[species-area relationship]] (SAR) originate early for [[LCIA method for land use impacts on ecosystem quality]], with potentials for global coverage, such as in [[Goedkoop2013_ReCiPe2008]].

Today, the [[GLAM]] recommends using [[Scherer2023_BiodiversityImpact]], the most advanced SAR based approach. It has:
- an habitat affinity model ([[species-habitat relationship|SHR]]), a SAR derivate accounting for the ability of species to survive after [[habitat transformation|habitat conversion]] (developped in [[Kuipers2021_ConsideringHabitat]])
- a large [[taxonomy]] coverage (mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibious, plants)
- a large geographical coverage (global)
- a good geographical accuracy ([[ecoregion]] specific)
- considers [[land use intensity]] (developped in [[Chaudhary2018_LandUse]])
- considers species [[species extinction risk]] (developped in [[Chaudhary2015_QuantifyingLand]])
- considers habitat [[habitat fragmentation]], through [[equivalent connected area]] (developped in [[Kuipers2021_ConsideringHabitat]])

The abovementioned method uses a SHR model, but [[It is still debated what approach is most accurate to model species-habitat affinities]].
