An **invasive alien species** is a specie that is not orginating from a region and was introduced via human direct or indirect intervention (e.g. via trade, or thanks to modified environmental conditions such as climate change).

Invasive alien species is one of the [[main pressures on biodiversity]] by human.

Invasive species can disturb stable local [[ecosystem]]s and sometimes destroy them (example with australia and rabbits).
