An **invasive alien species** is a specie that is not orginating from a region and was introduced via human direct or indirect intervention (e.g. via trade, or thanks to modified environmental conditions such as climate change).

Invasive alien species is one of the [[main pressures on biodiversity]] by human.

Invasive species can disturb stable local [[ecosystem]]s and sometimes destroy them (example with australia and rabbits).

>[!note] fun note
> any non endemic species is actually an exotic species because it has migrated to the current location at some point. But many native species are non endemic and considered "naturally" occuring in this location because they have not been introduced by human intervention.
