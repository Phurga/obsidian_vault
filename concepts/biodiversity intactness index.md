The **Biodiversity Intactness Index (BII)** is biodiversity indicator a measure of ecosystem intactness compared to a reference situation baesd on organisms abundance and diversity.

[[Scholes2005_biodiversityintactness]]
> The BII is an indicator of the average abundance of a large and diverse set of organisms in a given geographical area, relative to their reference populations.

## Formula
> The BII gives the average richness- and area-weighted impact of a set of activities on the populations of a given group of organisms in a specific area. The population impact (_I__ijk_) is defined as the population of species group _i_ under land use activity _k_ in ecosystem _j_, relative to a reference population in the same ecosystem type. The BII is calculated as:

> where $R_{ij}$ = richness (number of species) of taxon $i$ in ecosystem $j$, and $A_{jk}$ = area of land use $k$ in ecosystem $j$.

>[!warning] While [[species richness]] and area of [[land use]] are based readily available data, population impact $I_{ijk}$ is defined by experts based on field studies and is subject to expert opinions and misses data to be robust.
## Use
Used in [[planetary boundaries]] framework until 2023 for functional diversity, then replaced by another metric.
Used in [[PREDICTS]], as biodiversity indicator to estimates impacts of increasing [[land use intensity]].
