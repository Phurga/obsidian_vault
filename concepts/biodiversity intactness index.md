The **Biodiversity Intactness Index (BII)** is a biodiversity indicator, measuring ecosystem intactness compared to a reference situation based on organisms abundance and diversity.

Defined in [[Scholes2005_BiodiversityIntactness]]
![[Scholes2005_BiodiversityIntactness#^b08fcb]]
## coverage
![[Scholes2005_BiodiversityIntactness#^9c5bef]]
### taxonomic
![[Scholes2005_BiodiversityIntactness#^b3f06c]]

Functional taxonomic groups are:
- plants
- mammals
- reptiles
- bids
- amphibia
### geographic
6 ecosystem types are adressed (population impact is per ecosystem type) but richness data is associated to ecoregions
## Formula
The BII depends on the taxon richness, 
> The BII gives the average richness- and area-weighted impact of a set of activities on the populations of a given group of organisms in a specific area. The population impact (_I__ijk_) is defined as the population of species group _i_ under land use activity _k_ in ecosystem _j_, relative to a reference population in the same ecosystem type. The BII is calculated as:

> where $R_{ij}$ = richness (number of species) of taxon $i$ in ecosystem $j$, and $A_{jk}$ = area of land use $k$ in ecosystem $j$.

>[!warning] While [[species richness]] and area of [[land use]] are based readily available data, population impact $I_{ijk}$ is defined by experts based on field studies and is subject to expert opinions and misses data to be robust.
## Use
Used in [[planetary boundaries]] framework until 2023 for functional diversity ([[Richardson2023_EarthSix#^7c4021]]) now replaced with [[HANPP]] ([[Richardson2023_EarthSix#^8944cc]])
Used in [[PREDICTS]], as biodiversity indicator to estimates impacts of increasing [[land use intensity]].
