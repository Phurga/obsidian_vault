As they function, [[ecosystem]]s provide services to humans. These services are essential to supporting human life on earth. 

The main categories for ecosystem services are:
- [[provisioning service]] (eg production of wood)
- [[regulating services]] (eg climate or water regulation)
- [[cultural service]] (eg spiritual, recreational).

Proper delivery of these services requires a healthy, functional ecosystem, able to deliver its key [[ecosystem function]], sometimes named supporting services.

Ecosystem services are valued at $125 trillions ([[Costanza2014_ChangesGlobal]]).
An important step in the defintion of ecosystem services is the publication of [[MEA2005_Ecosystemshuman]].
