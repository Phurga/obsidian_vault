The **food web** (or **trophic web**) is a way of representing [[biological interaction]]s based on organisms food sources.

The term food web is more suited than **food chains** (or **trophic chain**) since the chain concept is too simple to model the complex interactions (one species can be a prey to numerous predators at different trophic levels).

Organisms in a food web are classfied as:
- [[autotroph|autotrophs]] (producers): organisms able to convert abiotic source of energy into biotic sources of energy. The main autotroph species are plants (and algae), converting sun and carbon dioxide into sugars through photosynthesis (phototrophy). The other main mode of autotrophy is chemiotrophy (energy from abiotic chemical compounds such as rocks).
- [[heterotroph]]: organisms feeding of biotic sources of energy. This conversion leads to some losses, with a rule of thumb that each conversion has a 10% energetic yield (90% loss). Among heterotrophs, we can consider:
	- primary consumers (herbivores), feeding of plants/algae.
	- secondary consumers (or primary predators).
	- tertiary consumers (or secondary predators).
	- etc up to apex predators
- among heterotrophs, we can differentiate one class: [[detritivore]]s, especially important in the [[soil food web]]. These species do not predate other species but feed of detritus decomposing tissues or excretions.

There are mixed modes of trophy, **mixotrophy**.

Soil organisms are sometimes referred as **oligotrophic**, referring to the low availability of food in soil (oligo: sparse).

## ecological networks beyond the food web
The food web is based on predation, and is thus an ecological network based on only one of several possible [[biological interaction]]s (mutualism, parasitism).
