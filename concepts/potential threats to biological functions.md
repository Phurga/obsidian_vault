The [[European Union Soil Observatory|EUSO]] has consolidated a map for **potential threats to biological functions** ([[Orgiazzi2016_knowledgebasedapproach]]).

Three pressure scores are defined:
- pressures on soil [[microorganism]]s
- pressures on [[soil biodiversity#Taxonomic and morphological classification|soil fauna]]
- pressures on [[soil function]]

These scores are calculated by weighting the effect of 13 [[pressures on soils]] affecting its biodiversity. Weights are defined by averaging the subjective scoring proposed by 91 experts in soil ecology, soil biology and other soil sciences.

The result of the model is a "pressure" value (adimensional) and is not linked with species richness or any other measure of biodiversity.

Proposed calculation (weighting of the pressures):

- HF refers to [[habitat fragmentation]], 
- GMO to use of [[GMO]] in agriculture, 
- IS to introduction of [[invasive alien species|invasive species]], 
- CC to [[climate change]], 
- SC to [[soil compaction]], 
- SS to [[soil sealing]], 
- SE to soil [[erosion]], 
- SSA to soil [[salinization]], 
- LUC to [[habitat transformation|land use change]], 
- NP to nuclear pollution, 
- IP to soil pollution from industry, 
- OMD to [[soil organic matter|organic matter]] decline, and 
- HE to [[land use intensity|intensive human exploitation]].

There is an interesting list of references to prove relations between species richness and some human pressures.

#todo/question isnt this method close to the [[biodiversity value increment]] method ? by calculating a biodiversity indicator from a set of environmental conditions ?
