**Soil compaction** is detrimental to soil structure and soil quality. A compacted soil has no porosity. Since porosity is habitat for all soil life, a compacted soil has no habitat and leads to biodiversity loss.

Soil compaction is caused by rainfall that can create a "croute de battance" (rain crust?), occuring especially when there is little organic matter in soil (few roots and other fibrous matter allowing the binding of [[soil aggregate]]). This crust is favoured by [[silt]]y soils: [[sand]]y soils will increase [[water permeability]], [[clay]] soils will favour aggregate formation.

A **structured soil** is an uncompacted soil
