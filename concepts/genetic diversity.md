**Genetic diversity** refers to the diversity of [[genes]] inside a [[taxonomy]] population.  It is one component of [[biodiversity]].

Genetic diversity is important to ecosystems for two main reasons: the necessity of genetic diversity for evolution to occur (evolutionary potential), and the expected relationship between heterozygosity and population fitness ([[Reed2003_CorrelationFitness]]).
# Indicators
Indicator for genetic diversity, targetting at evolutionary potential, based on [[Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework|GBF]]: [[minimum population size to maintain evolutionary potential|proportion of populations within species with an effective population size over 500]].
