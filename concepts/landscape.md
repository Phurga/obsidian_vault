**Landscapes** are assemblages of [[ecosystem|ecosystems]]. While an [[ecosystem]] is homogeneous when looked from afar, a landscape reveals heterogeneities.

See [[Noss1990_IndicatorsMonitoring]]

Landscape refers to [[Noss1990_IndicatorsMonitoring]]
> "a mosaic of heterogeneous land forms, vegetation types, and land uses” (Urban et al. 1987)

Landscapes are very similar to [[ecoregion]]s.
