In phylosophy of science, **constructivism** is the view that scientists build knowledge and find models explaining the appearing reality without describing any intrinsic reality. "All models are wrong but many are useful".

It is opposed to *objectivism* which considers that the purpose of science is to describe reality and find the truth.
