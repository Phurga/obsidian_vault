**Spatial patterns** in soil biodiversity needs further explanations, there are multiple theories and hypotheses for biodiversity generally but few are tested on soils.
- [[species-area relationship]] (and derivates such as [[species-energy relationship]])
- [[island biogeography theory]]
- [[metacommunity theory]]
- [[niche theory]] ([[biotope|ecological niche]])
- [[neutral theory]]
- [[physiological tolerance hypothesis]]
- [[habitat heterogeneity hypothesis]]
- [[resource heterogeneity hypothesis]]
- also rules based on [[ecological filtering]]

## application to soils
Some authors propose theories on soil spatial patterns which are currently misunderstood:

[[Thakur2020_integrativeunderstanding]], presents 5 theories:

[[Calderon-Sanou2022_betterunderstanding]] proposes another set of theories:
