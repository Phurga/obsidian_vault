Biodiversity is now usually presented as a multi-dimensional concept, going beyond [[species diversity]]. It also includes the [[genetic diversity]] (diversity of genes inside a species population) and [[ecosystem diversity]] (diversity of communities of species).

This is the definition agreed on in the [[convention on biological diversity]]:
[[SecretariatoftheConventiononBiologicalDiversity2011_ConventionBiological]]
> “Biological diversity” means the variability among living organisms from all sources including, inter alia, terrestrial, marine and other aquatic ecosystems and the ecological complexes of which they are part; this includes diversity within species, between species and of ecosystems.

One can also integrate [[landscape diversity]] above ecosystem diversity [[Noss1990_IndicatorsMonitoring]].

## roots
In [[Noss1990_IndicatorsMonitoring]], there is the mention of a popular source, [[OTA1987_TechnologiesMaintain]].
> A widely cited definition of biological diversity is “the variety and variability among living organisms and the ecological complexes in which they occur” (OTA 1987).
