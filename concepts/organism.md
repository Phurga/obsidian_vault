An **organism** is the unit for a living being functioning as an individual.

However defining an organism is challenging. A common definition involves the autonomous reproduction, growth and metabolism ([organism (wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism), [[Moreira2009_TenReasons]]).

But there are some forms of [[biological organisation]] which are not singlecell or multicellular organisms and yet have organismal properties:
- [[mutualism|mutualist]] relationships (lichen)
- superorganisms such as ant colonies
- colonial organisms (siphonophore)

[[virus]]es are not organisms based on some definitions
