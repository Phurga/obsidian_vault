**Fungi** (singular fungi) are [eukaryote]s, [[heterotroph]]ic [[microorganism]]s. They show a high diversity of life forms and high functional diversity, filling many [[biotope|ecological niches]] over the world. They feed of dispersed lignin materials in soils or live in symbiosis with plants (90% of terrestrial plants have symbiosis with fungi [[Bonfante2003_PlantsMycorrhizal]]).

There are most likely millions of fungi [[taxonomy|species]] in the world while only a few 100'000s have been named ([[Anthony2023_EnumeratingSoil]]).

Fungi can be unicellular (yeasts) or very large multicellular organisms, spreading via a network of **hyphae**, microscopic needle like structures 10 micrometer thick, constituting a meter (if not kilometer) long network called the **mycelium**. Mycelium is invisible to they eye, except when bundled in packets, showing as white small roots. Fungi can also disperse via spores, emitted by their above ground fruits (the **mushroom**). 

Many fungi live in a [[symbiosis|symbiotic relationship]]s with other organisms. The most important interaction is with plants: fungi form [[mycorrhiza]]s and exchange nutrients or water for energy with their host. Fungi can live in interaction with algae or cyanobacteriae, creating a lichen.

The concept of an [[mean species abundance|individual]] for a fungi is not very relevant because several "individuals" can share the same genome, as fungi are decentralized organisms with the capacity to regenerate from some tissue put in favourable conditions.
## ecological functions 
As [[detritivore]]s, fungi are important drivers of [[carbon transformation]] in soil ecosystems, with important chemical capacity to degrade many carbon compounds. Fungi in the [[rhizosphere|rhizosphere]] make up for a large portion of soil organic carbon in [[ecosystem]], especially in [[pristine]] soils.
Fungi can be very important sources of [[soil organic matter|soil organic carbon]] (up to 70%), especially in [[boreal forests]] ([[Clemmensen2013_RootsAssociated]]).

Fungi can help plants absorb nutrients (especially [[phosphorus]]), by demultiplying the plants root network through what is called a [[mycorrhiza|mycorrhizosphere]] (network of digits with extended active surface around roots). This occurs for instance with arbuscular mycorrhyzal fungi (AMF).

Fungi hyphae are very important drivers in the formation of [[soil aggregate]] and detrimental for good [[soil structure]]. Fungi mycelium also produces glomalin, a protein that acts as glue for smaller soil particulates.

Fungi are basal elements in the [[soil food web]], and have important capacities to emit or metabolize chemicals, leading to important [[biological regulation]] functions.

The extent of ecological functions filled by fungi is still unknown and their [[functional diversity]] could be even more important that what is known.

Fungi can decompose inorganic carbon ([[biomineralization]]), attacking calcium carbonate (Bindschedler et al., 2016). [[FAO2020_StateKnowledge]]
## pressures on fungi
Fungi are heavily disturbed by [[deforestation]] and [[habitat transformation|land transformation]] to agriculture, especially due to [[tillage]], breaking the mycelium and reduced organic matter to feed off ( #todo/refneeded ).

> Les *myxomycètes* sont des [eucaryotes](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eukaryota "Eukaryota") unicellulaires qui se caractérisent par la formation d'un [plasmode](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmode "Plasmode") (vrai ou [pseudoplasmode](https://fr.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pseudoplasmode&action=edit&redlink=1 "Pseudoplasmode (page inexistante)")). Ils étaient initialement réunis aux [champignons](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champignon "Champignon"), car leurs cycles de vie comportent une étape de [sporulation](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sporulation "Sporulation") végétative macroscopique. Ce regroupement s'est avéré [polyphylétique](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphyl%C3%A9tique "Polyphylétique"), car formé de plusieurs lignées indépendantes de [protistes](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protiste "Protiste"), aucune d'elle n'étant liée aux « champignons vrais » du règne des [Fungi](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungi "Fungi").
