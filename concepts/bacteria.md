**Bacteria** are unicellular [[prokaryote]] [[microorganism]], very abundant on Earth and spread everywhere. Their total biomass is similar to plants and with a [[C to N ratio]] of 5, they make up the main source of nutrient on Earth (Madigan et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2017, through [[FAO2020_StateKnowledge]]). 
They are very efficient chemical machines able to decompose complex chemicals in air or in the soil into simpler molecules available to other organisms ([[microbial loop]]). They tend to specialize on a given molecule to use as a resource, filling [[biotope|ecological niches]] and explaining their important [[species richness|alpha diversity]]. 

Bacteria can have effects on their surroundings via pure chemical activity or via [[enzyme|enzymatic]] activity.

Bacteria can be [[dormancy|dormant]] for extended periods of time. For this reason, it is difficult to talk about [[dead soils|soils are never never dead]]. Organisms are not dead but inactive, and will be active once favourable conditions are found, for instance after inputs of soil organic matter, after being eaten but not digested by an earthworm, etc.
## Morphology and anatomy
As prokaryotes, bacteria do not have a nucleus and their [[DNA]] is diffused in the cytoplasm.


![[Bernard2025_Microorganisms_bacteria_anatomy.png|600]]
There are 7 morphotypes of bacteria but 1 milion+ [[taxonomy]].

The concept of species is difficult to apply to bacteria because they reproduce asexually, can mutate and can perform clonage.
## Ecological functions
Bacteria can decompose litter and carbon compounds, favouring [[carbon transformation]].

Bacteria are important members in the [[nutrient cycling]] process, with what is known as the [[microbial loop]]. Bacteria can have [[mutualism|mutualist]] interactions with plants: [[plants]] will release [[exudates]] for bacteria to use as food. Bacteria will convert these exudates in simpler molecules, that plants will use back when they are unable to produce exudates and need these nutrients. 
Bacteria can also be degraders, digesting nutrients from external sources, such as [[biological nitrogen fixation|nitrogen fixing bacteria]], converting atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia, which is in turn available to plants.
This behavior sometimes avoids the leaching of nutrients to water streams and convert these molecules to ones available to plants (in the case of bacteria fixing nutrients under other forms).

Bacteria can promote good [[soil structure]] by producing substances binding soil particles together ([[soil aggregate]]).

Healthy soils have abundant bacteria, most of them being mutualists or degraders, outperforming and eliminating pathogenic ones. Some bacteria produce antibiotics against pathogenic bacteria.

Bacteria compounds are found in the cells of higher-level organisms (ie higher in the food chain) and thus influencing their health.

Bacteria being at the base of the food chain, bacteria diversity and abundance is detrimental to the proper functioning of ecoystems.

Some bacteria can also be [[autotroph]]s but this is not a dominant mode in soils.

Some bacteria can have [[bioremediation]] capacities (decomposing pollutants such as pesticides or oils).

Bacteria-rich soils will tend towards [[higher pH]].

## Pressures on bacteria
Bacteria are harmed with substances changing pH (such as the presence of [[metallic compounds]] or calcites), disrupting their metabolism.
Agricultural soils receiving mineral fertilizers lead to plants ignoring bacteria and the latter disappear, disrupting the [[microfood web]].

## Studying bacteria
Many microorganisms go undetected in soils due to a lack of tools to detect them.
### old manual approach
We used to study bacteria by extracting some in a solute and multiplying them. Then you count the developed colonies and extrapolate original populations. But we noticed only a fraction of the existing bacteria can be farmed (some are not suited to nutrient rich conditions or any other specifics to labs). However this is the only way to understand their metabolism and thus their function.
Bacteria are smaller than plants and animals cells and are hardly visible on optical microscopes.
[[the vast majority of microbial biodiversity had been missed by cultivation-based methods]]
### indirect approaches
Indirect approaches consist in measuring microbial biomass or microbial carbon (fumigation extraction).
### genetic approaches
Better approaches now include genetic approaches: [[DNA metabarcoding|metabarcoding]] (isolation of full chains of DNA of many organisms in a sample) and metagenomic approaches (studying fragments of DNA that are further reassembled).
ARN16s gene allows for phylogenetic classification because it is linked with the evolutionary history of the organism.
It is difficult to link microorgs genome with their function, beyond DNA databases and statistical approaches (experiments linking function and presence), functional inference approaches exist #todo  https://doi.org/10.1093/gigascience/giab090
## classification
ny species can coexist on a single supplied resource thanks to widespread cross-feeding[13](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-18529-y#ref-CR13 "Goldford, J. E. et al. Emergent simplicity in microbial community assembly. Science 361, 469â€“474 (2018)."). Enviro
