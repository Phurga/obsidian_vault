**Simpson index** is a metric for species diversity defined in 1949 in [[Simpson1949_MeasurementDiversity]].

[wikipedia](;;;)
> The measure **equals the probability that two entities taken at random from the dataset of interest represent the same type**.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diversity_index#cite_note-Simpson1949-10) It equals:
> ${\displaystyle \lambda =\sum _{i=1}^{R}p_{i}^{2},}$
> where _R_ is richness (the total number of types in the dataset). This equation is also equal to the weighted arithmetic mean of the proportional abundances _p__i_ of the types of interest, with the proportional abundances themselves being used as the weights.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diversity_index#cite_note-Hill1973-1) Proportional abundances are by definition constrained to values between zero and one, but it is a weighted arithmetic mean, hence _λ_ ≥ 1/_R_, which is reached when all types are equally abundant.

It inspired the Chao1 index in [[Chao2005_NewStatistical#proposed indicator]].
