**Evolutionary biology** focuses on processes guiding the **evolution** of species and changes in genes.

The four main processes/forces guiding evolutionary processes are:
- selection, 
- drift, 
- mutation, and 
- gene flow.
## evolutionary ecology
**Evolutionary ecology** is a subbranch of evolutionary biology, focusing on how the interactions among species affect evolutionary processes.
## evolution and biodiversity
**Evolution** is the process leading to [[biodiversity|life diversity]] on Earth.
Then maybe a relevant metric for biodiversity should cover the capacity of evolution to be maintained.
