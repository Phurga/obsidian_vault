**Extracting DNA** from organisms cell is an important step in [[environmental DNA|DNA sequencing]].

This is done by:
- breaking down the organisms cells ([[lysis]]),
- precipitating DNA (DNA becomes a pack of white filaments),
- purificating, i.e. isolating DNA from other molecules, using chemical and physical (centrifugation) techniques,
- concentrating the DNA, removing excess liquid

This is not a complicated process.
