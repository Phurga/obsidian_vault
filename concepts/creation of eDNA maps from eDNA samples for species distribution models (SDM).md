eDNA data are still sparse and are highly local (points)
SDM require rasters and there is a need to convert eDNA data into rasters by, i suggest, creating buffers around sampled points
deep learning methods could be used to generate eDNA maps based on environmental conditions ? Is it not training by masking ?
