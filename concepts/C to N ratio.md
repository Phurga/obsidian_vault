The **C to N** ratio refers to the ration of [[carbon]] to [[nitrogen]] in an [[organism]]. This composition will define the C to N ratio of the food the organism will target (eg plants).

If an organism feeds on richer (lower C to N ratio) food, it will concentrate the N in the excretions (eg human urine).

The C:N ratio gives indications on community [[biodiversity|composition]] while C:P ratio gives indications on community [[biological activity|activity]], because [[RNA]] is the molecule for activity (more activity leads to more ARN) and ARN has [[phosphorus]] in it.

| organism     | C to N |
| ------------ | ------ |
| [[bacteria]] | 5      |
| [[fungus]]    | 15     |
| [[plants]]   | 10-40  |
| human        | 7      |
