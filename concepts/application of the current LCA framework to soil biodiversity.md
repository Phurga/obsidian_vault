[[soil biodiversity|soil biodiversity]] [[life cycle assessment]] [[biodiversity]] 
[[LCIA method for land use impacts on ecosystem quality]]

opportunities
- [[nematode]]: a well-characterized taxon and important indicator of [[soil quality]], to be investigated
- operational [[metagenomics]] and [[DNA metabarcoding]] methods to list soil [[DNA]]
- [[biodiversity]] through interactions ([[coocurrence]] networks)
- differentiation of practices
	- microbial biomass
	- nematodes
	- soil organic carbon (labile)

challenges
- remanent dna in soil: does not indicate living or dead species (high risk of dead dna for several years)
	- recrossing with [[RNA]]?
- [[dormancy]]: problem identifying the disappearance of a species?
- homogenization of communities (e.g. earthworms) linked to [[effect of human perturbation on soil biodiversity|homogeneisation of landscapes]]: gamma biodiversity out of scope?
- concept of [[taxonomy]] complicated for [[bacteria]]
- concept of individual (and therefore [[mean species abundance|species abundance]]) complicated for bacteria (colonies) and especially [[fungus]] (decentralization of the organism, one dna can be shared by several mycelia)
- take [[rhizosphere|roots]] into account?
