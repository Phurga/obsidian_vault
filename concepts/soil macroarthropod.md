**Soil macroarthropods** are [[soil arthropod|arthropods]] in the size range from 2 mm to 5 cm.
[[ant]] and [[termite]] are well studied but there is generally an important [[taxonomy|taxonomic diversity]] of soil macroarthropods, such as spiders, isopods, millipedes and many insects such as beetles, even temporarily during their immature stages. These animals feed on all [[soil food web|trophic levels]] such as detritivores, herbivores, parasites, predators, and thus increase organic matter decomposition rates by accelerating litter decomposition, excrement production and biological regulation.
# Ecological functions
Macroarthropods have less direct impacts on [[carbon transformation]] and [[nutrient cycling]] than microbes but have an amplifying effect, building on the micro powerhouse. Some predator can also reduce carbon and nutrient content of soils by overpreying detritivores or plants. Some cascading effects due to disruption of food chains could be expected but are not defined.
