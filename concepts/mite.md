**Mites** are [[soil microarthropod|microarthropods]]. They can be [[detritivore]], [[parasits]] or [[predators]]. They represent a fraction of the soils carbon conten (4% [[Fierer2009_Globalpatterns]]) but are non-negligible in accelerating [[carbon transformation]] and [[nutrient cycling]] as they breakdown [[litter]], through mechanical work but also indirectly by spreading [[fungus]] spores.

Mites and springtails are not [[ecosystem engineer]]: they cannot create pores in the soil but only use them as [[biotope|habitat]]. They are classified as [[litter transformer]].

Predatory mites feed of [[nematode]] and other microarthropods. They in particular eat nematodes that feed on plant roots, and so predatory mites improve plant growth, and are used as [[bioaction]]. Predatory mites generally regulate herbivorous fauna in the [[litter]].
