An **operational taxonomic unit (OTU)** is a cluster of DNA sequences grouped by similarity. It is a "pragmatic proxy for species at different taxonomic levels" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_taxonomic_unit).
The definition of the OTU is determined by the threshold used in similarity calculations (stricter thresholds leads to lower OTU count in a DNA sequence for the same sample).
