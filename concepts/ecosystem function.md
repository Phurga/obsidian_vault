A healthy [[ecosystem]] is defined by its capacity to deliver key **ecosystem functions**, formerly named supporting services (obsolete). These supporting services enable the delivery of the main [[ecosystem service]].

Ecosystem functions were formerly named **supporting services**, wording made obsolete since these are not really services, but rather functions, since they do not directly provide human benefits.

Ecosystem supporting services include:
- [[primary production]] (eg photosynthesis), 
- [[nutrient cycling]],
- [[water cycling]],
- carbon cycling ([[carbon transformation]]),
- [[soil formation]],
- [[O2 production]], 
- [[habitat provision for all species]].

## Application to soils
[[FAO2020_Stateknowledge]] considers 4 main [[soil function]] (carbon transformations, nutrient cycling, soil structure, biological regulation).
