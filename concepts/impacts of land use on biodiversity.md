![[McGill2015_FifteenForms#visual summary of biodiversity trends]]
There is a global decrease of species richness (species extinction) but no general observation of regional or local species richness decrease. There is a stabilisation of local richness (replacement) and an increase of regional richness.
Human use land as a resource and modify the natural environment to increase the value of this resource. These modications lead to the destruction of some [[biotope|ecological niches]], and the creation of others. There is usually a net destruction of niches since human favour specialisation, hence homogeneisation of the environment ([[IPBES2019_Globalassessment#human causes community homogeneisation]]).

There could be optimums in land use leading to maximized richness, see [[the intermediate disturbance hypothesis]]

[[Chaudhary2018_LandUse]] identifies and quantifies reduced impacts for light and minimal intensity agriculture compared to intensive (refering to [[Newbold2015_GlobalEffects]] and [[Chaudhary2016_ImpactForest]]). Taxa coverage is limited.

compare [[Burton2022_LandUse]] (showing important negative effects of land use intensification on soils species abundance) and [[Labouyrie2023_PatternsSoil]] (showing positive effect of land use intensification on soils species richness).
[[Romdhane2022_LanduseIntensification]] observes contrasted results.

Soil work ([[tillage]]) leads to [[soil compaction]] which destroys soil [[soil structure|porosity]], destroying [[biotope|habitat]] to most [[soil macrofauna]] and crushing organisms such as [[earthworm]] who are crushed.

[[Pollution]] have adverse effects (pests, metals), with [[bioaccumulation]] in larger species so larger species are more affected by pollutions, such as cloportes.

It is possible to study and represent [[food web|trophic chains]] in an ecosystem and assess the response to a perturbation (before after network) [[Hedde2025_DiversityRoles]], to be published.

Cultivated ecosystems show more (soil) biodiversity than non cultivated ([[Hedde, Mickael]], [[Labouyrie2023_PatternsSoil]]).
