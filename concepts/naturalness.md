Quantification, for an [[ecosystem]], of the closeness to its natural state, undisturbed by human.
High naturaless signify being close to the natural state. High hemeroby signify being far from the natural state. 

Note that areas in high naturalness states might not maximize [[biodiversity]], productivity or [[soil quality]]. Also, conservation policies might not target the highest naturalness (such as the CBD vision "living in harmony with nature"). Known as said in [[Fehrenbach2015_Hemerobyimpact]]:
> Additional protection targets or impact endpoints in the context of land use are not necessarily sufficiently addressed by the hemeroby concept. For instance, an undisturbed primary forest area at the final succession stage in Europe is not associated with the highest biodiversity per area, the highest net primary production or the highest soil carbon content. In fact, human intervention could maximise these factors.

[[Winter2012_Forestnaturalness]] reviewed and proposes defintions and a framework for naturalness.
[[Fehrenbach2015_Hemerobyimpact]] defines a framework to use hemeroby as a midpoint indicator in land use LCIA on biodiversity (with debates on midpoint vs endpoint).
Operationalized in LCIA in [[Lindner2019_ValuingBiodiversity]], see [[naturalness in LCIA]].
