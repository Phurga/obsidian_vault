**LUCAS** is a European survey meant to classify [[land use]] and land cover in Europe ([[EuropeanCommission2025_LUCASLand]]). It thus provides an extended source of #data for geographical information on land cover and soil.

Since 2009, it also has a soil module ([[Fernandez-Ugalde2022_LUCAS2018]]) compiling geographical information about soil quality and biodiversity.
# land classification
LUCAS uses its own standardized land classification: [link](https://showvoc.op.europa.eu/#/datasets/ESTAT_LUCAS_Classification_2022_%28LUCAS_SU_LC_%2B_LU_%2B_FT%29/data), below is a simplified version.
