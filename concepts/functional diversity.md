**Functional diversity (FD)** refers to the diversity of functions filled by species in an ecosystems, and is calculated via the diversity of organisms [[species trait|traits]] found in an ecosystem. FD can be represented with several variables. Ecosystem with high functional diversity are considered healthier and more resilient #todo/refneeded.

The 3 main variables representing functional diversity are ([[Mason2005_Functionalrichness]]):
- [[functional richness]]
- [[functional eveness]]
- [[functional divergence]]

# Use in LCA
Implementing functional diversity (FD) in LCA methods is tricky since it requires additional data linking species with their functional traits in order to measure FD.

There are two known implementation of FD in the LCA framework:
- [[Scherer2020_CharacterizingLand]], covering plants only, globally.
- [[MaiaDeSouza2013_Landuse]], covering america, for plant, mammals and birds.

There is no method covering more taxa and more regions.
