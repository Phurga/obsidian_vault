Soil is composed of **organo-mineral aggregates**. These aggregates have various sizes and composition, which leads to a great variety of [[biotope|habitat]] in [[soil]], and in turn a great [[biodiversity]].
This is a 'cookie' like structure, you can separate crumbs by hand of decreasing sizes. Humidity is key in the binding of these agregates.

The soil aggregated based organisation of soils allow for [[biotope|habitat]] formation (of different sizes) and [[water permeability]].

[[clay]] is at the foundation of soil's organo-mineral aggregates, when combined with [[soil organic matter|organic matter]].

Formation of soil aggregate is favoured by the production of [[earthworm]] mucus, and other organic substances providing binding properties.

Smaller aggregates (microaggregates) are increasingly aquatic habitats, hosting most [[microorganism]] (who are then aquatic organisms). This is water is difficult to evaporate, and is an important source of medium term soil humidity.

**Humus** is an outdated name for organo-mineral compound. It used to no correspond to no physical reality and was used with different meanings.

[[FAO2020_StateKnowledge]]
> The soil is a complex and heterogeneous system, comprising organo-mineral aggregates of different sizes and organic components, that creates habitats for soil biodiversity across multiple spatial scales; the diversity in habitat composition with pores of different sizes filled with air and/or water allows an incredible number of taxa of different sizes and ecology to inhabit it (Andre, Ducarme and Lebrun, 2002).
