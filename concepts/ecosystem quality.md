**Ecosystem quality** is an [[LCIA|area of protection]] in [[LCA]]. Its purpose is to assess the condition of an [[ecosystem]] compared to a [[reference situation|reference state]].
It aims at capturing the "[[intrinsic value of nature]]", i.e. considers [[biodiversity]] for what it is, for patrimonial motivations, instead of for what it provides human, the latter being studied as part of [[ecosystem service]]s.
