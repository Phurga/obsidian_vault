**Soil texture** refers to the composition of soil in terms of particle size. It is an important [[soil physical property]]. Texture classes are defined based on the relative content in [[sand]], [[silt]], [[clay]].

Clay rich soils have a sticky texture. They have strong structure, sometimes too strong.
Silts rich soils have a flour like (soft) texture. They have little structure. They can create crusts under rain when there is little organic matter to maintain [[soil aggregate|soil organo-mineral aggregate]].
Sand rich soils have no structure.
