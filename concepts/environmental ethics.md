**Environmental ethics** is part of ethics and thus phylosophy. It approaches human relationship with the natural world, defining principles guiding our actions.
## main paradigms
The main paradigms of environmental ethics are ([[Sandler2012_IntrinsicValue]]):
- **Anthropocentrism** is the ethics where only human interests need to be taken into account (Pinchot 1914, Baxter 1974).
- **Nonanthropocentrism** is the ethics that at least some non-human interests need to be taken into account as well. (There is another conception of nonanthropocentrism on which a view is nonanthropocentric if it implies that non-human nature possesses intrinsic value of any type e.g., natural historical value, inherent worth, or subjective intrinsic value).

- Within nonanthropocentrism, 
	- **sentientism** is the ethics that only psychologically complex entities (e.g., those that experience pleasure and pain) need to have their interests considered (Singer 1977), while
	- **biocentrism** is the things that the good of all living things need to be taken into account (Taylor 1986).
		- **ecocentrism** is an ill-defined word considered as an extension of biocentrism. Definitions include:
			- accounting for nature as a whole, beyond living organisms to natural processes.
			- sometimes considered as a more inclusive form of conservation accounting for human as part of nature (instead of a top down vision of human protecting nature).
	- theocentrism, considering nature as god's creation ?

## nature conservation
**Nature conservation** is environmental ethics translated into action. Its expression changes based on value choices (anthropocentrism, ecocentrism).

**Conservationism** is a form of nature conservation approach based on biocentrism, generally using the science of [[conservation biology]] to guide its actions.
## use in LCA
It is useful to go back to when working on [[LCIA method on ecosystem quality]], what it should capture and how to quantify it, because [[monitoring the advancement of conservation policies is the main goal of biodiversity LCIA]].
