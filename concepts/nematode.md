**Nematodes** are small, thin worms, of lenght between micrometer to few milimeters (excepted some parasitic in the cms range, but not in soils). 
They mainly feed on soil's [[microorganism]] ([[fungus]], [[bacteria]], [[protozoae]]) but can also be herbivores, insectivores etc.

A nematode.

## Classification
### phylogeny
Nematodes are not [[earthworm|annelid]]s (and thus not [[earthworm]]), but have a worm shape. Worm shapes are very common in soils since they provide capacity to move inside soil porosity while allowing for room for internal organs.

Nematodes are everywhere (soil, marine, freshwater animal microbiota). On land their are especially abundant in temperate and boreal biomes.. They represent up to [80% of the individual animals on earth]((https://doi.org/10.1038%2Fs41586-019-1418-6)) and [90% of all animals in the ocean floor]((https://doi.org/10.1038%2Fs41586-019-1418-6)) ! Nematodes is a highly diverse taxon (trophic groups, size, mouth morphology).
### trophic chain

## Anatomy
Nematode biology is simple: one external membrane containing a cytoplasme under pressure giving shape to the nematode, with muscles, with a digestive system and a reproduction system. No respiratory or circulatory system.

Their mouth have high diversity because it is specialised on the food it eats.

## reproduction
Reproduction is variable: between 40 and 1000 eggs per cycle, cycle between few days to 1 year.
Nematodes are slow in soils but can put their eggs on the surface where they will be dispersed via wind.
## maturity index, cp groups
The maturity index [[Bongers1990_MaturityIndex]] is an index based on nematode composition to define the maturity of an ecosystem.

cp groups is a classification of nematodes indicating the maturity/stability of an ecosystem: cp1 is for new ecosystems while cp5 is for steady ecosystems

## ecological functions
Nematodes are known for adverse functions in [[agriculture]] ([[parasite]]s for plants), but they are also important ecosystem members, favouring [[nutrient cycling]], part of the trophic chain ([[carbon transformation]]).
Nematodes have detrimental effects only when they overshoot a specific density (function of species and ecosystem variables).
Nematodes can stimulate plants and their exsudates.
Nematodes can regulate microbes communities (by eating them, or helping them when they eat them and release them with their rich excretions).
Nematodes are very [[endemic]] (specific to local conditions).
Omnivore nematodes are a good indicator of healthy soils.
Some nematodes were found [[dormancy|dormant]] after decades and even milenia.
## use in agronomy and indicators
Nematodes can be used as indicators for soil quality:
- total nematode [[mean species abundance|species abundance]]
- abundance per trophic group
- abundance per gp group (maturity) see https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00324627
- abdundance per functional group (nutrient increase, structured community)
- land use specific metrics, or region specific indices
Nematode indices are relevant because nematodes are easier to study than microorganisms and have been more studied, so there is extensive databases on their presence (esp USA).
[[Elisol]] environnement proposes soil diagnostics based on nematodes study. [elisol.fr](https://www.elisol.fr/)
90% of what nematodes is rejected as such because nematodes have a forced digestion (pumping with mouth) and their digestive system might not have the capacity to digest microorgs or nutrients. This favours the movement of microorganisms and concentrates nutrients.
Nematodes can be indicators for composition of microorgs ([[fungus]] vs [[bacteria]]).

> [!Warning] : currently we do not have a framework to link nematode species and functional diversity. Nematode richness cannot be used as a proxy for microorganisms richness :(
