[[environmental DNA|eDNA]] methods for invertebrates communities is not mature yet, different markers lead to different results, and taxon specific results (annelids vs arthropods), and anyway most [[operational taxonomic unit|OTU]] remain unidentified ([[Kirse2021_UnearthingPotential]])

there is no clear link between [[metagenomics]] and [[ecosystem function]] ([[Prosser2015_Dispersingmisconceptions]])

the presence and abundance of genes does not mean its activity ([[dormancy]], [[DNA remanence]]) ([[Prosser2015_Dispersingmisconceptions]])

eDNA persistence duration is being investigated, with varying estimates for plants (50 years in [[Yoccoz2012_DNAsoil]], >60 years in [[Foucher2020_Persistenceenvironmental]])

eDNA techniques allowed for rapid calculation of species richness for arthropods in forests [[Jabot2025_Usemassive]]

#todo/question could we use eDNA databases only at the [[operational taxonomic unit|OTU]] level (with BINs in the BOLD database) to calculate richness values (at regional scale rather than at local scale - ie gamme vs alpha diversity).
