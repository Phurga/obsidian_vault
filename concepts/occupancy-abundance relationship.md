**Occupancy abundance relationship** is a well documented relationship linking the potential habitat area of a specie with its [[species abudance|abundance]].

It is similar to the [[species-area relationship]] but for the abundance.

See [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupancy%E2%80%93abundance_relationship).
