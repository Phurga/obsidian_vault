**Soil quality** is currently a focus in LCA. [[Soil]]s are not only a resource to use for [[ecosystem service]] but also [[biodiversity]] hotspots. In the current approach, these two dimensions of soils are separated and soil focusing indicators only cover the capacity of soils to provide services ("soil quality").

[[UNEP2019_GlobalGuidance]] proposes a partially implemented impact pathway:
![[UNEP2019_GlobalGuidance_pathway_soils.png]]

Indicators exist to assess the impacts of human activities on soil quality. Sources: [[UNEP2019_GlobalGuidance]] updated with [[DeLaurentiis2024_Soilorganic]]
- [[soil organic matter|SOM]] change ([[MilaiCanals2007_Methodassessing]])
- [[soil organic matter|SOC]] change ([[Brandao2013_Globalcharacterisation]] via [[IPCC2019_2019Refinement]], updated in [[DeLaurentiis2024_Soilorganic]] #todo/refneeded )
- [[biotic production]] ([[net primary production]] and [[Koellner2013_UNEPSETACguideline]])
- [[Erosion]] (at inventory level using [[RUSLE]] with [[Nunez2013_Inclusionsoil]] and [[Sonderegger2020_AssessingImpacts]] or at impact pathway only with [[LANCA]])
- [[soil quality index]] (SQI) based ([[Agroscope]] with [[SALCA-SQ]], [[PEF method]], others)
- salinisation ([[Payen2014_Passsalt]]), 
- soil compaction ([[Sonderegger2020_AssessingImpacts]]), 
- reduction in groundwater regeneration potential, and mechanical and physicochemical filtration potential ([[LANCA]]).
- chemical pollution of soils is covered through [[ecotoxicity]] and [[acidification]] indicators.

# [[GLAM]] recommendation
The recommendation was to use SOC, despite being a [[proxy indicator]] because ([[UNEP2019_GlobalGuidance]]):
> SOC is to some extent an implicit indicator of the amount of soil biota present in soil. (...) SOC is positively correlated with the four key [[soil functions]] as defined by Kibblewhite, Ritz et al. (2008): carbon transformations; nutrient cycling; soil structure maintenance; and the biological population regulation of soil fauna. (...) SOC does not represent all aspects of soil quality. **Erosion, chemical pollution and salinization are processes that have a weak correlation with SOC.**

Other contenders but rejected [[UNEP2019_GlobalGuidance]]
> The Swiss agricultural life cycle assessment ([[SALCA-SQ]]) model (Nemecek, von Richthofen et al. 2008) combines several indicators using a mechanistic process-based composite model into an SQI, but was not considered for inclusion in this assessment, as it was developed specifically for the Swiss context and relies mostly on expert knowledge and detailed primary data.

The folowing means LANCA is not ok for a SQI ([[DeLaurentiis2019_Soilquality]])
> Several authors agreed that a contribution based on observed correlations using multi-parametric statistics could be used to link soil quality attributes to a one-dimensional SQI (Andrews, Karlen et al. 2002; Vel√°squez, Lavelle et al. 2007; Obriot, Stauffer et al. 2016). However, such an approach is not currently available, and failing this, there is no consensus on alternative approaches to calculate a soil quality index (Andrews, Karlen et al. 2004; de Paul Obade and Lal 2016; Obriot, Stauffer et al. 2016).
