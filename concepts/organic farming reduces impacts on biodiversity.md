Species richness in organic farming, [[Tuck2014_Landuseintensity]]
> This analysis affirms that organic farming usually has large positive effects on average species richness compared with conventional farming. (...) The effect of organic farming varied with the organism group and crop studied, and with the proportion of arable land in the surrounding landscape. We found larger effects in cereals, among plants and pollinators, and in landscapes with higher land-use intensity.

Organic farming effect on soil organisms diversity, [[Tuck2014_Landuseintensity]]
> Despite the fact that organic farming has been suggested to have large effects on soil conditions, its effects on soil organisms were ambiguous and in general understudied.

The organic controversy, [[Tuck2014_Landuseintensity]]
> The logic of this argument runs as follows: lower yields push up food prices, and as a consequence, more wild or marginal land is brought into agricultural production. This wild land is likely to have supported even higher biodiversity than the organic farm; hence, begging the question, is there an overall cost of organic farming to biodiversity?

[[Chaudhary2018_LandUse]] identifies and quantifies reduced impacts for light and minimal intensity agriculture compared to intensive (refering to [[Newbold2015_Globaleffects]] and [[Chaudhary2016_ImpactForest]]). Taxa coverage is limited.
