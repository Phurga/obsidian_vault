In [[life cycle assessment]], **territorial LCA** is an approach focusing on an administrative subunit (a territory) in order to support [[environmental policy]]s at territorial scale such as land management plans. 

There are specific challenges related to the territory function (and thus functional unit definition), as well as the system boundaries definition (production oriented, consumption oriented, regional dependencies).

It was developped by [[Loiseau, Eleonore]] during a PhD submitted in 2014.
