**Land use** is the occupation of land for human use, as opposed to natural land. Land use is usually classified in **land use classes**, usually following a hierarchical organization of increasing refinement.
## classification
### land use classes
The main land uses and associated classes are :
- [[forestry]], also named managed forest land,
- [[agriculture]], also named agricultural land, usually subdivided into:
	- annual cropland, also named arable land, 
	- permanent cropland, sometimes named plantations (warning there is sometimes an ambiguation between plantations of food trees and plantations of timber trees)
	- pastures or meadows, (sometimes confused with grasslands, see land cover)
- [[artificial land]], or developped land, used for residence and tertiary use (urban), industries, mines etc.
- [[semi-natural land]], not directly used but recovering from past human use or under very light use such as for leisure,

These classes are usually subclassified depending on [[land use intensity]], for instance in forestry, it is common to discriminate between forestry involving [[clear cutting]] or [[selective logging]].

Some land show heterogeneous patterns and are difficult to classify, or lead to new mixed classes, such as mozaic agriculture, used for agroforestry or landscapes including arable land and hedgerows.

>[!warning] Some land use class systems include non used land, such as primary forest or natural land. This is correct for general use but should not appear in any [[LCI]] because by definition, if it appears in the LCI, it is used for human systems. Semi-natural land can appear in LCIs.
### land cover classes
Land can also be classified according to its bio-physical coverage rather than its socioeconomic use. In that case, non-used land are classified and we are talking about land cover.
Land cover classes include:
- forest land,
- shrub lands,
- herbaceous land, or grasslands,
- agricultural area,
- artificial area,
- wetlands,
### standard classifications
In Europe:
- The simplified land cover used in the [[ESA WORLD COVER dataset]]
- The CORINE land cover class recommended to be used by the European Environment Agency. It is apparently superseded with 
- the EUNIS classification at European level [link here](https://inpn.mnhn.fr/habitat/cd_typo/7?lg=en) or 
- the [[LUCAS]] classification ([link here](https://showvoc.op.europa.eu/#/datasets/ESTAT_LUCAS_Classification_2022_%28LUCAS_SU_LC_%2B_LU_%2B_FT%29/data)).

Globally:
- The [[LCCS]] developped by the UN.
- There is IPCC land use classification.
- The GLAM land use classification.

## quantification
Land use is considered to be an occupation of land and occupation infers a use over time. This means the conventional unit for land use is **surface multiplied with time** (e.g. ha.year).

Some studies measure land use in ha, assuming implicitely a result for one year. This can be misleading when the occupation does not occur for a full year, such as for agricultural land with crop rotations, and when the occupation occurs for more than one year, such as for forestry with trees occupying land for decades.
