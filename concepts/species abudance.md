**Species abundance** refers to the number of organisms for a given [[taxonomy]]. It is usually used in relative terms, such as relative species abundance (relative to other species abundances) or relative to a reference state, such as [[mean species abundance]].

High abudance is linked with high [[biomass]] levels, but is not correlated with [[species richness|species diversity]].

Abundance measures can be individual organisms count or biomass measures if organisms numerical count is challenging.
