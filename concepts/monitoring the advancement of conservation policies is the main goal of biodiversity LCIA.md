Monitoring the advancement of [[nature conservation]] policies is the main goal of [[LCIA method on ecosystem quality]].

[[Vrasdonk2020_inclusionBiodiversity]]
> We recommend that reference situations for biodiversity in LCIA models should be developed based on biodiversity targets aligned with societyâ€™s conservation frameworks. Only measurements of deviation away from or closer to a desired reference situation make it possible for decision makers to distinguish the varying biodiversity-related costs and benefits that are associated with different production systems.

[[Lindner2019_ValuingBiodiversity]]
> In summary, any LCA indicator quantifying biodiversity should conform to conservation efforts, i.e., good or best practice management should be reflected in a favourable LCA indicator score, while intrusive interventions should be punished.

[[Fehrenbach2015_Hemerobyimpact]]
> The pivotal question in land use and nature conservation remains the fundamental query what precisely we are attempting to protect. This question may be answered in a number of different ways. Biodiversity conservation may be the primary goal, or safeguarding of ecosystem services, the conservation of soil fertility or naturalness. Any of the above qualify as a possible and appropriate answer.

> The goal is an agricultural ecosystem rich in structural and species diversity in which disturbance caused by production practices is reduced to the minimum necessary for the maintenance of sustainable productivity.

[[Vrasdonk2019_Referencesituations]]
> For example, the global Convention on Biodiversity (CBD) which is based on the vision "Living in Harmony with Nature" does not aim predominantly at naturalness but emphasizes the sustainable coexistence of humans and biodiversity by stating that BBy 2050, biodiversity is valued, conserved, restored and wisely used, maintaining ecosystem services, sustaining a healthy planet and delivering benefits essential for all people^ (UN CBD 2010, p. 8).

Conclusion of Lindner after listing the expectations of the different stakeholders in the definition of a [[LCIA method on ecosystem quality]], the stakeholders being:
- decision makers (using LCA results)
- LCA practicioners (performing LCAs)
- LCA scientists (developping the LCA framework)
- conservationsits (source of information for LCA scientists)
