The convention on biological diversity is an important milestone in [[nature conservation]].
It is an international treaty to protect [[biodiversity]] signed by (150) countries in 1992 at Rio for the [[Earth Summit]].

In the 15th reunions of nations (COP 15 for CBD) in 2022, members signed the [[Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework]] (GBF). Countries took commitments on a 2050 mission, backed up with intermediate 2030 targets for nature conservation.

I like this quote:
[[CBD2000_Sustaininglife]]
> A major cause of this erosion is that individuals, communities and nations take the resource for granted. There is an assumption, based on thousands of years of development, that living resources and biological diversity are limitless. Despite isolated instances of where communities, even civilizations, have ignored this responsibility and suffered dramatically as a result, for most of us the idea that we might be reaching the limits of its endurance is beyond our experience and comprehension.
