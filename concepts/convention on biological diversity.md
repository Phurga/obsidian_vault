The **convention on biological diversity** is an international treaty to protect [[biodiversity]] signed by (150) countries in 1992 at Rio for the [[Earth Summit]]. It is an important milestone in [[environmental ethics]].
### Kunming Montreal GBF
In the 15th reunions of nations (COP 15 for CBD) in 2022, members signed the [[Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework]] (GBF) for nature conservation. Countries took commitments on a 2050 mission, derived in 4 goals and numerous intermediate 2030 targets.
