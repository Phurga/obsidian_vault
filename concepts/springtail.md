**Springtails** are [[soil microarthropod|microarthropods]], hexapods, not insects, few mm in size. Also named **collembola**.
They [jump](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXeSnWY6DNc) over their predators and eat [[microorganism|microbes]] ([[fungus]], [[algae]], [[detritivore]]).

Populations are not so huge but they exist and accelerate [[litter transformer|litter decomposition]]. They most likely have similar roles as mites, they regulate herbivorous populations ([[biological regulation]]).
