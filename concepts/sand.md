**Sands** are small mineral particles (50micron<size<2mm).

Sands have no [[electronic reactivity]], and do not bind with [[soil organic matter|organic matter]], but have great [[water permeability]] properties. Sandy soils are well drained, avoiding anaerobic conditions, floods and [[rain crust]], but do not retain water: sandy soils are susceptible to [[drought]]s.

Sands are formed from the degradation of the bedrock (or occasionally through transports). Particles larger than sands are gravels but are considered  too coarse to influence the soil texture (considered as macro elements).
