As defined in [[Brondizio2019_globalassessment]], there are 5 main pressures on [biodiversity]():
- [[habitat transformation|habitat transformation]] (land use change)
- direct exploitation ([[overexploitation]])
- [[climate change]]
- [[pollution]] ([[acidification]], [[eutrophication]], [[ecotoxicity|toxic substances]])
- [[invasive alien species]]

[[Habitat transformation]] alone drives one third of terrestrial biodiversity decline globally. Land use change is primarly driven by agriculture, forestry and urbanization. Agriculture intensification increased productivity on the short term, but depleted [[natural resource]] with long renewable rates. For instance, soil fertility has degraded, with observed declines in productivity for equivalent practices. [[Brondizio2019_globalassessment]].

| Pressure               | Status                                                                 |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Habitat transformation | Several, see [[LCIA method for land use impacts on ecosystem quality]]                      |
| Direct exploitation    | Only one beyond LCA method ([[PBF]])                                   |
| Pollution              | Covered through [[acidification]], [[eutrophication]], [[ecotoxicity]] |
| Climate change         | Covered, see [[LCIA of climate change on biodiversity]]                |
| Invasive alien species | [[invasive alien species\|invasive species]]                           |
There are multiple methods to consider impacts on biodiversity from [[land use|land occupation]] and [[habitat transformation|habitat transformation]].
There are methods to derive biodiversity enpoints indicators from climate change and pollution midpoints.
I do not know about invasive alien species and direct exploitation.
There is currently no approach that manages to capture all species group at a global scale.

Suggested methods :
Terrestrial exotoxicity (PAF)> Rosenbaum 2011 + Owsianiak 2013 for HM, to PAF
Terrestrial acidification (SO2eq>PDF)> Rot 2012, Azevedo 2013
SOC change (Mila i Canals 2013) > Verones 2024
Soil erosion potential (Bos 2016, LANCA2), without permanent damage (max damage duration set at 85y).
