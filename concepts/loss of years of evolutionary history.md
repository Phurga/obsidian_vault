[[Chaudhary2018_ProjectingGlobal]] proposes an indicator for impacts on biodiversity based on [[phylogenetic diversity]]: the **loss of years of evolutionary history**, measured in milions of years.

This indicator goes beyond [[relative species loss]] indicators and derivates, accounting for the inequivalencies of species lost: some species are unique 'branches' in evolutionary history and their extinction is more critical to genetic diversity.

The method uses species-specific [[evolutionary distinctiveness scores]] (ED) to calculate how much years of evolutionary history is lost upon losing one specie. But I have not investigated much more this article.
