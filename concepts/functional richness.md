Describes the amount of functional niche space filled by species. It relates to the range of resources used and thus to productivity, environmental tolerances, and invasion resistance. [[Mason2005_FunctionalRichness]]

High FDr does not mean that many niches are filled, only that the most extreme niches are different.
