[[Statistics]] methods are used to check if a result is **statistically significant**. 
### p values
The most common approach is to use **p values**.
A common accepted p value for significance is p < 0.05, but this threshold is criticized.
p values below 0.001 are also important.
star levels are commonly used to defined significance (1*; 2*; 3*).
See [[Wasserstein2019_MovingWorld]]

s values can also be used (s = -log2(p)), easier to interpret
