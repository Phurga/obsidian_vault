Because of the complexity and multiple dimensions of [[biodiversity]], there cannot be a single indicator for biodiversity, quoting [[Hedde2025_Diversityroles]], but following the complexity of its definition.
# facets of biodiversity
Three facets for biodiversity [[Godet2017_Notiondebat]]:
- [[taxonomy|taxonomic]] (morphology)
- [[functional diversity]] (ecological functions, [[food web]])
- [[phylogenetic diversity]] (evolutionary history)

Note: these facets apply to species diversity.
# species composition indicators
[[Compositional diversity]] indicators are sometimes used to measure biodiversity, especially in [[LCA]]. This is mostly motivated by data availability to allow for global coverage of the biodiversity erosion issue.
Species composition was also found to be a good proxy for ecosystem functioning #todo/refneeded 
# indicators at different spatial scales
Biodiversity can be measured at different spatial scales.
This variability is mostly relevant for species richness.

If measured in an homogeneous habitat is also refered to as [[alpha diversity]], meaning the total number of species found in this space. This space can be considered as one [[ecosystem]]/community. There is no quantification of this space as it varies depending on the taxon studied (e.g. for mammals it can be a valley, for microorganims it can be a soil portion).

[[Beta diversity]] is a metric to measure the variability of alpha diversity for a given changing variable (environmental gradient). For instance, a monocultural crop system will have very low beta diversity when studying variation across space, since the ecosystem is very homongeneous across space.

There is sometimes mentions of [[gamma diversity]], comparing the diversity at regional scale, for instance looking at diversity of ecosystems in a regional landscape. It aims at combining alpha and beta diversities to retrieve species diversity at regional scale (it is not the variability of alpha diversity inside the region, but the alpha diversity itself, inside the region).

[[Godet2017_Notiondebat]]
> À partir de jeux de données basés sur les espèces, les mesures classiques de biodiversité incluent la richesse (le nombre d’espèces) et la diversité (le nombre d’espèces et leurs abondances relatives) à différentes échelles spatiales : alpha (échelle de la station), beta (le long de gradients environnementaux) et gamma (à l’échelle de la région).

[[Pyron2010_CharacterizingCommunities]]
> Three levels of diversity have been studied by community ecologists. Alpha diversity is within-habitat diversity. Beta diversity is between-habitat diversity. This refers to changes in diversity along an environmental gradient. Gamma diversity or large-scale landscape diversity combines alpha diversity and beta diversity.

# implementations in LCIA
In LCA, most biodiversity indicators focus on species composition, but there are some alternatives. See [[LCIA method on ecosystem quality]]
