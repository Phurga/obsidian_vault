Correlative species distribution models link observations of species with key environmental variables in order to estimate a species ecological niche and predict the potential locations where the species could survive or thrive.

Defining a set of environmental variables influencing soil biodiversity based on soil conditions (see [[Burton2022_LandUse]] or [[Labouyrie2023_PatternsSoil]]), combined with soil properties maps (see [[LUCAS]]) could lead to the definition of a [[species distribution model]] for soil organisms (esp. arthorpods and fungi since they are available in the [[PREDICTS]] database), maybe to be completed with the [[BOLD Systems]] database and the [[Crowther2020_GlobalDatabase]] database for nematodes.

The current LCIA methods for biodiversity use an habitat-species affinity parameter in the countryside SAR model ([[Scherer2023_BiodiversityImpact]]). This is a relationship between species and habitat but not really a habitat suitability model since it does not consider any environmental variable but is only based on empirical measures of taxonomic richness under specific land use classes (in th [[PREDICTS]] database).
