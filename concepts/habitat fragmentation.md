**Habitat fragmentation** is the phenomenon where human modification of landscapes breaks spatial continuity of habitats. For instance, creating a road in the middle of the forest breaks the continuity of the [[biotope]].
## link with species richness
Given that habitat size is a factor of [[species richness]] (see [[species-area relationship|SAR]]) and [[species abudance]] ( #todo/refneeded ), 1 patch of 2 m2 tends to have more richness and abundance than 2 patches of 1 m2, and thus habitat fragmentation needs to be accounted for in [[species richness]].
## habitat patches connectivity
In a fragmented habitat landscape, one can account for habitat connectivity (species dependent), i.e. the probability of species to be able to join two distinct patches.
See [[equivalent connected area]].
## data
[[Ibisch2016_globalmap]] provides a dataset for habitat fragmentation due to roads.
