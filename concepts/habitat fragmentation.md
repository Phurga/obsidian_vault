[[biotope|Habitat]] fragmentation is the phenomenon where human modification of landscapes breaks spatial continuity of habitats. For instance, creating a road in the middle of the forest breaks the continuity of the [[biotope]].

[[Ibisch2016_globalmap]] provides a dataset for #todo
Given that habitat size is a factor of [[species richness]] (see [[species-area relationship|SAR]]) and [[species abudance]] ( #todo/refneeded ), 1 patch of 2 m2 tends to have more richness and abundance than 2 patches of 1 m2, and thus habitat fragmentation needs to be accounted for in [[species richness]]
