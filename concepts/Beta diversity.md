**Beta diversity** is an [[measures of biodiversity|indicator]] the differentiation of the [[ecological composition|ecological community]] for different habitats. 

It was historically measured as the ratio between [[alpha diversity]] and [[gamma diversity]] but is now measured using [[sorensen similarity index]] (ratio of species appearing in both communities and total number of species), avoiding considering two communities with different compositions but equal richness as having the same biodiversity. Beta diversity can be used to show the variation of diversity for a given changing variable (environmental gradient).

Example: 
- a monocultural crop system will have very low beta diversity when studying variation across space, since the ecosystem is very homongeneous across space.
- changes in sorensen indexes across land use allows to study the influence of the choice of land use on community and identify additional changes beyond pure species richness, identifying replacement of individuals.

In [[Labouyrie2023_Patternssoil]], beta diversity is used as an indicator of [[biodiversity|community structure]]. #todo/notsure  i do not understand this idea.
