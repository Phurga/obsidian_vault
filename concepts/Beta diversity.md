**Beta diversity** is a measure of the change in [[ecological composition|ecological community]] for a varying variable (an environmental gradient). 

It was historically measured as the ratio between [[alpha diversity]] and [[gamma diversity]] but is now measured using [[sorensen similarity index]] (ratio of species appearing in both communities and total number of species), avoiding considering two communities with different compositions but equal richness as having the same biodiversity.

Beta diversity is usually measured for a variation of space (across latitude for instance).

Example: 
- a monocultural crop system will have very low beta diversity when studying variation across space, since the ecosystem is very homongeneous across space.
- changes in sorensen indexes across land use allows to study the influence of the choice of land use on community and identify additional changes beyond pure species richness, identifying replacement of individuals.

In [[Labouyrie2023_PatternsSoil]], beta diversity is used as an indicator of [[biodiversity|community structure]]. #todo/notsure  i do not understand this idea.
