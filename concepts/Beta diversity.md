**Beta diversity** is a metric to measure the variability of [[alpha diversity]] for a given change in an environmental variable (environmental gradient). It can be seen as sensitivity of species richness for a given variable. 

For instance, a monocultural crop system will have very low beta diversity when studying variation across space, since the ecosystem is very homongeneous across space.

In [[Labouyrie2023_Patternssoil]], beta diversity is used as an indicator of [[biodiversity|community structure]]. #todo/notsure  i do not understand this idea.

See [[measures of biodiversity#indicators at different spatial scales]].
