Biodiversity is not only **compositional** (constituents of the system) but also **structural** (interactions in the system) and **functional** (functions in the system, such as trophic chains (food web)).

- [[functional diversity]]

>[!note] I used to write "Biodiversity is not only compositional diversity (constituents of the system) but also structural diversity (interactions in the system) and functional diversity (functions in the system, such as trophic chains (food web))." But it is not about compositional *diversity* or other subdiversities. It is abount composition, period.

## source of the concept
[[Noss1990_IndicatorsMonitoring]] proposes a multi dimensional framework to define the multidimensionality of biodiversity
> In this paper, I expand the three primay attributes of biodiversity recognized by Jerry Franklin - composition, structure, and  function - into a nested hierarchy that incorporates elements of each attribute at four levels of organization: regional landscape, community-ecosystem, population species, and genetic.

see [[noss indicators]]
>[!warning] [[Franklin1981_Ecologicalcharacteristics]] focused on forests, to which structure would make much more common sense (than the expanded meaning for concepts such as genetic structure).
