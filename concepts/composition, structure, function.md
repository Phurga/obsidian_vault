Biodiversity is not only [[compositional diversity]] (constituents of the system) but also [[structural diversity]] (interactions in the system) and [[functional diversity]] (functions in the system, such as [[food web|trophic chains]]).

[[Noss1990_IndicatorsMonitoring]] proposes a multi dimensional framework to define the multidimensionality of biodiversity
> In this paper, I expand the three primay attributes of biodiversity recognized by Jerry Franklin - composition, structure, and  function - into a nested hierarchy that incorporates elements of each attribute at four levels of organization: regional landscape, community-ecosystem, population species, and genetic.

This framework is based on [[Franklin1981_Ecologicalcharacteristics]] who focused on forests, to which structure would make much more common sense (than the expanded meaning for concepts such as genetic structure).
