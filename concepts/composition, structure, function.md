Biodiversity is not only **compositional** (constituents of the system) but also **structural** (interactions, spatial and temporal aspects in the system) and **functional** (functions in the system, such as trophic webs).

>[!warning] 
>[[Franklin1981_Ecologicalcharacteristics]] focused on forests, to which structure would make much more common sense (than the expanded meaning for concepts such as genetic structure).
>Now I would rather follow the [[essential biodiversity variables]] which consider ecosystem structure and ecosystem function (and species traits for functional ecology). Instead of this abstract view of structure beyond ecosystem...

>[!note] note
> I used to write "Biodiversity is not only compositional diversity (constituents of the system) but also structural diversity (interactions in the system) and functional diversity (functions in the system, such as trophic chains (food web))." But it is not about compositional *diversity* or other subdiversities. It is abount composition, period.

## source of the concept
[[Noss1990_IndicatorsMonitoring]] proposes a multi dimensional framework to define the multidimensionality of biodiversity, beyond the trifecta [[genes, species, ecosystems]].

> In this paper, I expand the three primay attributes of biodiversity recognized by Jerry Franklin - composition, structure, and  function - into a nested hierarchy that incorporates elements of each attribute at four levels of organization: regional landscape, community-ecosystem, population species, and genetic.

> Composition has to do with the identity and variety of elements in a collection, and includes species lists and measures of species diversity and genetic diversity. 
> Structure is the physical organization or pattern of a system, from habitat complexity as measured within communities to the pattern of patches and other elements at a landscape scale. 
> Function involves ecological and evolutionary processes, including gene flow, disturbances, and nutri- ent cycling.

see [[noss indicators]] for operational indicators related to this classification
### modern use of the concept
[[ecosystem integrity]] retrieves this three dimensions
