In [[life cycle impact assessment]] there is problem in methods because we want to discriminate versions of a system using foreground [[activity data]], but rely on background activity data to model unknown parameters.
The impact assessment step is done using generic LCIA methods, that are developped to be applied to the whole world (large spatial coverage). This **high spatial coverage** is usually possible at the expense of **low spatial accuracy**.
While high spatial coverage is required for background data, high spatial accuracy is required for foreground data. Meanwhile, **data consistency** is required in the assessment stage (the same method should be used for all parts of the system, treating it equally).
