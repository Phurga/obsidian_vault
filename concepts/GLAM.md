The **Global Life Cycle Impact Assessment Method (GLAM)** is an initiative launched by the [[UNEP]] under the [[UNEP-SETAC Life Cycle Initiative]] program. Its goal is to provide a consensual, global, extensive LCIA method representative of the current state of the art in LCA.
It includes many experts in the field and other stakeholders.

It is similar to the [[PEF method]], launched by the EU commission, but is tutelled by the United Nations. However, Europe being a hotspot for LCA, the PEF remains important.
