A **taxon** (plural **taxa**) is a group of [[species]]. 

Many taxa are based on the **phylogenetic classification** of species (e.g. arthropods, bacteria), but some taxon are not philogenetic classes. Some taxon are vernacular names of phylogenetic groups, such as birds whose phylogenetic group is *aves*. Some taxon are polyphyletic groups, such as [[Invertebrate]] (defined as what is not inside the 'vertebrate' class), thus combining several phylogenetic groups. Another example for polyphyletic groups is [[algae]] (eukaryotes that can perform photosynthesis, excluding some specific taxon).
