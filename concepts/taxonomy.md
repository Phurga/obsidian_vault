**Taxonomy** refers to the classification of organisms.

**Species** is used as the smallest unit in the classification. Species names are following the binomial nomenclature : species = genus + epithet e.g. Homo + sapiens ([[von Linn√©, Carl]]).

A **taxon** (plural **taxa**) is any taxonomic group, e.g. a species or group of species.
## phylogenetic classification
Modern taxonomy is based on **phylogeny**: the study of evolutionary relationship between organisms ([libretext](https://bio.libretexts.org/Courses/Sacramento_City_College/Biology_342_-_The_New_Plagues/02%3A_Classifying_Pathogens_and_Hosts/2.01%3A_Taxonomy_and_Phylogeny)).

Usual ranks in the taxonomic classification:

### paraphyletic taxa
- Some taxa are *phylogenetic* (e.g. arthropods, bacteria).
- Some taxon are *vernacular* names of phylogenetic taxon, such as birds being vernacular for aves.
- Some taxon are not phylogenetic are are based on some similarity (such as morphology):
	- Some taxon are *polyphyletic*,
		- [[protist]]s are eukaryotes that are neither fungi, plants or animals.
		-  [[algae]] are eukaryotes that can perform photosynthesis, without the need of common ancestors.
- Some taxon are *paraphyletic*, i.e. have all a common ancestor, excluding a few groups
		- [[reptile]]s (see wikipedia)
[[invertebrate]]s are paraphyletic because of some complicated reason but i would put them in polyphyletic...

## species
 The **species** is the smallest unit in taxonomic classification. The definition of a species is a challenge in biology and ecology. 
 
  Identifying a species is challenging: you have to prove that the species does NOT belong to an existing species through specific traits (morphology, genome, anatomy). These limits are not obvious in some cases (species complex or ring species).

Evolutionary processes leads to species changing over time ([[biodiversity dynamics]]).
### definition for macrobes
 For macrobes, the definition of a species is usually done based on the ability of two organisms to produce a fertile offspring: in that case the two organisms are of the same species. 
### definition for microbes
 This definition is sometimes challenged for microorganisms, or organisms that reproduce asexually or are prompt to mutations  [[Anthony2023_EnumeratingSoil]] (see quote below), [[Gevers2005_Reevaluatingprokaryotic]], [[Doolittle2006_GenomicsBacterial]]. Challenges include:
 - observation of morphological, physiological and functional traits is challenging for microorganisms
 - [[horizontal gene transfer]]
 - asexual reproduction
 - high mutation rates
This leads to using definitions based on DNA sequence or RNA region similarity.
