### questions
- check for compositional similarity between two datasets:
	- [[compositional similarity]] indices
- is my result (tested hypothesis) statistically significant
	[[statistical significance]], including p values
- is the difference between two groups in a sample (based on a criteria) significant
	- student t test or ANOVA for more groups
### data exploration and visualization
- finding correlations between input data to predict output data
	- [[machine learning]] as used in [[deep species distribution model]]
- understand and quantify which variables explain the variability of another variable (multivariate analysis)
	- ANOVA and derivates for multivariates (MANOVA), two way ANOVA for categorical variables, ANCOVA to find covariance
	- PCA: transforms vectorial space of initial parameters into an equal dimension parameter space but creating linear combination of original parameters into a set of most explicative abstract parameters (sorted decreasingly) 
	- RDA, of which db-RDA
	- CCA
#todo understand what are euclidean distances and how it affects the method choice
