> Different extrapolation techniques have been used to arrive at global fungal species richness estimates, including publication rates of new taxa ([2](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/microbiolspec.funk-0052-2016#core-b2)), plant:fungus ratios ([3](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/microbiolspec.funk-0052-2016#core-b3), [4](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/microbiolspec.funk-0052-2016#core-b4)) similar to plant:insect ratios first used in Erwin’s famous study ([5](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/microbiolspec.funk-0052-2016#core-b5)), quantitative macroecological grid-based approaches ([6](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/microbiolspec.funk-0052-2016#core-b6)–[8](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/microbiolspec.funk-0052-2016#core-b8)), methods based on environmental sequence data including plant:fungus ratios ([9](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/microbiolspec.funk-0052-2016#core-b9), [10](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/microbiolspec.funk-0052-2016#core-b10)), and ecological scaling laws ([1](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/microbiolspec.funk-0052-2016#core-b1)).

> (...) we demonstrate that fungal richness is decoupled from plant diversity. The plant-to-fungus richness ratio declines exponentially toward the poles.
