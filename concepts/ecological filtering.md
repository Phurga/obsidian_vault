**Ecological filtering** refers to rules considered to explain the spatial distribution of organisms based on limiting factors (filters). The three main are:
- **abiotic filter**: habitat suitability for species, concept of [[Grinnel niche]], modeled in [[species distribution model]]s.
- **biotic filter**: no predator, excess competition or any other [[biological interaction]] limiting the presence, concept of [[Elton niche]]
- **dispersal filter**: the organism must be able to reach the location from a previous suitable location, linked to [[migration]]

>One of the most fundamental schematics shown in any introductory ecology class depicts the hierarchy of ecological filters thought to give rise to local communities from a regional species pool.
