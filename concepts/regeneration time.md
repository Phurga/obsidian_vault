**Regeneration time** is the time require for an ecosystem to regenerate to the reference state after an initial occupation has stopped being maintained, and the human pressure on the ecosystem is "relased".
[[Brandao2013_Globalcharacterisation]] proposes defaults regeneration times:
- 20 years for biotic land use (pasture, arable, forest),
- 85 years for artificial land use (sealed land such as urban area).
#todo/refneeded pasture should regenerate faster than arable land because it is already closer to its natural state than a monoculture.

It is used in [[LCA]] to calculate [[habitat transformation|land transformation]] impacts based on [[land use|land occupation]] impacts.
