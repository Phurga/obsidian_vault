**PREDICTS** is project led by the [[UK National History Museum]].
https://www.nhm.ac.uk/our-science/research/projects/predicts.html
## the database
PREDICTS is known to have published a global database of species composition for a wide range of taxon ([[Hudson2017_databasePREDICTS]]) ^[First publication in [[Hudson2014_PREDICTSdatabase]].].

#data raw data available here https://data.nhm.ac.uk/dataset/release-of-data-added-to-the-predicts-database-november-2022

> (...) containing more than 3.2 million records sampled at over 26,000 locations and representing over 47,000 species.
## use of the database
The authors of the database also derived [[biodiversity intactness index]] values for countries regions etc: https://data.nhm.ac.uk/dataset/bii-bte

This led to estimates of impacts of [[land use intensity]] on [[biodiversity]]: [[Newbold2015_Globaleffects]] (using [[biodiversity intactness index]]) and [[Newbold2016_Globalpatterns]] (using [[sorensen similarity index]]).
### use in LCA
Was used in [[Scherer2023_BiodiversityImpact]] for vertebrate data, but the database has coverage for vertebrates, plants, arthropods, other animals, and fungi.
