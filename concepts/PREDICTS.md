First publication [[Hudson2014_PREDICTSdatabase]].
Update in [[Hudson2017_databasePREDICTS]], "containing more than 3.2 million records sampled at over 26,000 locations and representing over 47,000 species".
# Use in LCA
Was used in [[Scherer2023_BiodiversityImpact]] for vertebrate data, but the database has coverage for vertebrates, plants, arthropods, other animals, and fungi.
