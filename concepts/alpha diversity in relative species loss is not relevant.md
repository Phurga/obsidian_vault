As recommended in by the UNEP SETAC Life Cycle Initiative, species richness is the recommended metric for measuring biodiversity, and relative species loss (RSL, usually named potentially disappeared fraction of species, or PDF) is the recommended metric for impacts on ecosystem quality ([[Verones2017_LCIAframework]], [[Woods2018_Ecosystemquality]]).

Several LCIA methods have been developped to account for this loss of species ([[Damiani2023_CriticalReview]]), with several approaches being considered.

1. One method is to use a collection of species inventories, compiling these inventories to derive average alpha richness values associated to a given land occupation (land use class and geographical location). Land occupation characterization factors are then derived comparing this value to a reference value (usually, the value of the local natural counterfactual state ([[Vrasdonk2019_Referencesituations]]). This method is for instance used in [[deBaan2013_LandUse]].
2. The other method is based on the species-area relationship.
