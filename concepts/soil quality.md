**Soil quality** (or **soil health**) is the ability of the [[soil]] to sustain the productivity, diversity, and environmental services of terrestrial ecosystems ([[FAO2020_DefinitionSoil]]).
## multiple definitions
Soil fertility, soil productivity, soil quality, soil health, soil security: several evolving terms characterizing what we value in soils and our understanding of this complex medium. Blurry definitions disentangled in [[INRAE2025_PreserverQualite]] and [[FAOandITPS2015_StatusWorlds]].

Soil health mentions tend to refer more on the biological dimension of soils, considering soils beyond productive or even utilitarian values.

 [[Doran2002_SoilHealth]] and [[Vidal-Legaz2017_SoilQuality]]: 
>  **Soil quality** (or **soil health**) is the capacity of a living soil to:
> - function within natural or managed ecosystem boundaries
> - to sustain plant and animal productivity
> - to maintain or enhance water and air quality
> - to promote plant and animal health

[[Marsden2025_IntroductionSoil]]
> soil quality is soil's capacity to deliver [[soil ecosystem service]]s.

[[INRAE2025_PreserverQualite]] do not provide a clear definition but state they refer to soil health based on achieve soil functions.
## the three components of soil quality
Soil quality depends on biological, chemical and physical components ([[Marsden2025_IntroductionSoil]], [[INRAE2025_PreserverQualite]])

[[soil physical property]]
[[soil chemical properties]]
[[soil biodiversity]]

There are feedback loops between soil physico-chemical properties and soil biology !
## soil functions
See [[soil function]]
## indicators
Conversely to air or water, there is no "pure" soils and it is impossible to have an absolute measure of soil quality [[INRAE2025_PreserverQualite]]. Indicators are sensitive to the definition of the soil and what we are measuring.
