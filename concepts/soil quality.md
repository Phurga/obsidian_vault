## the three components of soil quality
Soil quality depends on biological, chemical and physical components ([[Marsden2025_Introductionsoil]], [[Cousin2025_Preserverqualite]])

[[soil chemical properties]]
[[soil biodiversity]]

There are feedback loops between soil physico-chemical properties and soil biology !

Conversely to air or water, there is no "pure" soils and it is impossible to have an absolute measure of soil quality [[Cousin2025_Preserverqualite]]
