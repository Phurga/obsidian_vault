# Related definitions
A biotope hosts a community of organisms, living sustainably: its [[ecological composition]].

An **ecological niche** is the theoretical biotope specific to a species or group of species, it is the **habitat** of a species.

According to https://www.canr.msu.edu/resources/habitat-niche
> A **habitat** is the place where an organism lives, while a **niche** is that organismâ€™s role within that environment. Habitat focuses on how the environment impacts the organism while niche focuses on how the organism impacts the environment. Both habitat and niche are important concepts to understanding the balance of an ecosystem and the biodiversity found there.
