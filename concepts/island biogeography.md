**Island biogeography** is a subfield in [[biogeography]], with theories applying to isolated land masses. 

The main postulate is that [[species richness]] in an island is determined by im[[migration]] and [[extinction]].

[[MacArthur2001_theoryisland]] is a foundational book to document this theory.

One important rule deriving from this theory is the [[species-area relationship]].
