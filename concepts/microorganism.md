A **microorganism** is an organism in the micron range in terms of size, and thus cannot be seen with the naked eye, requiring specific tools or processes. Two great families of microorganisms are [[prokaryotes]] (unicellulars, such as bacteria and archae) and [[eukaryote]] (generally multicellulars, having a nucleus, such as fungi and algae).

They include (soil related taxon):
- [[bacteria]] and [[archae]] (prokaryote)
- [[fungus]] (eukaryote)
-  [[protist|protists]] ([[algae]] and [[protozoae]]) (eukaryotes)
- [[virus]] (neither)

It is difficult to study microorganisms because of their size and very specific habitats (difficult to isolate and reproduce in lab conditions). See [[bacteria#Studying bacteria]].
