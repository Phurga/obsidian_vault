The conversion of [[hemeroby class]] ([[ordinal scale]]) into a hemeroby characterization factor (cardinal scale) can be done in several ways, because [[ordinal-to-cardinal conversion]] is impossible in maths.

There are 7 hemeroby classes, and class I is sometimes excluded from the ordinal transform, as it is the case in Fehrenbach, claiming that class II has a BV value of 0 (although it looks like it is a minority position).
Transform can be linear, exponential, or even different.

Ultimately, [[Fehrenbach2015_Hemerobyimpact]] recommends an exponential interpolation while [[Lindner2019_ValuingBiodiversity]] uses a linear interpolation. 

| Hemeroby class | Fehrenbach DNP <br>(exponential) | Lindner BV <br>(linear) |

| IV             | 0.125                            | 0.5                     |
| III            | 0.0625                           | 0.334                   |
| II             | 0.0313                           | 0.167                   |
| I              | NA                               | 0                       |
The conversion is land use class dependent: forest and agricultural land have different ranges for possible hemeroby (i.e. the agricultural land with the best practices will have more hemeroby than the forest with the best practices).
