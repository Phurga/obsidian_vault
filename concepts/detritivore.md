Detritus include decomposing organisms tissues as well as feces. Detritivores are abundant in [[soil]], with for instance [[earthworm]], [[fungus]], [[bacteria]], [[protist]]s.

Detritivores are **decomposers**. The word decomposer corresponds to the ecological role of detritivores in the ecosystem, i.e. [[nutrient cycling]] and decomposing complex organic molecules into simpler ones (part of [[carbon transformation]].

Soil detritivore microorganisms enable the [[microbial loop]].
