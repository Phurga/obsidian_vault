**DNA metabarcoding** is a high throughput [[environmental DNA]] sequencing method. It can be classified as a metagenetic method.

The method consists in:
- sampling some soil or water in the environment,
- [[DNA extraction|extracting eDNA]],
- amplifying DNA, i.e. mass replicating specific gene regions ([[marker]]) using [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR), the replicated DNA fragments are called *amplicons* and mutate during the PCR phase (*chimeras*),
- sequencing the DNA, i.e. translating nucleotide sequences into a barcode such as GATTACA...,
- analyzing data to identify the species in the sample, via DNA databases such as the [[BOLDSystems2025_Homepage]].
- optional: identify species characteristics (functional traits) using [[trait databases]].
