**DNA metabarcoding** is an [[environmental DNA]] sequencing method based on DNA barcoding. It can be classified as a metagenetic method.

The method consists in:
- sampling some soil or water in the environment,
- [[DNA extraction|extracting eDNA]],
- amplifying DNA, i.e. mass replicating specific gene regions ([[marker]]) using some [[primer]]s to perform [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR),
- sequencing the DNA, i.e. translating nucleotide sequences into a barcode such as GATTACA...,
- analyzing data to identify the species in the sample, via DNA databases such as the [[BOLDSystems2025_Homepage]].

# DNA barcoding
Note that one can do simple DNA barcoding, i.e. targeting a single marker from a single organism.
