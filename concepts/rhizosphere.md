The **rhizosphere** is the region of [[soil]] influenced by plant roots, constituted of the root and the soil a few mm around the root. 
## Root development and effect on the soil
### Effect on soil
Roots act on the soil via several pathways, the main ones being:
- nutrient absorption (NH3+, NO3-, PO4-3),
- excretion of acid compounds (to stabilize its internal charge after absorbing cations),
- respiration (CO2),
- [[exudates|exsudation]],
- rhizodeposition (abovementioned exsudates or dead root tissues)

Roots can be considered ecosystem engineers. This activity fosters surrounding [[microorganism|microbial]] communities. It constitutes a [[microbiome]], comprising both the inside of the root (where [[fungus]] enter and interact) and the outside of the root, home of many chemical reactions and biochemical reactions with [[bacteria]] and [[archae]].

Root exsudates can change soil ph, dissolving for instance minerals to go through or retrieve [[phosphorus]]. The emissions of H+ or OH- compounds will depend on the absorbed ions, such as mineral fertilization: [[ammonia]] (NH3+) induces the release of anions ([[acidication]]) to reach electronic stability, while [[nitrate]] (NO3-) induce the release of cations ([[alkanization]]).
### Root growth
Soil being an [[oligotrophy|oligotrophic]] medium, and plant individuals being immobile, they need to develop advanced strategies to explore exploit and modify the soil. Plants look for nutrients and water in soils. Their energy and carbon comes from aboveground [[photosynthesis]], they do not capture carbon from soil. Mineral [[phosphorus]] can be found dispersed in the soil in mineral form, but nitrogen is usually bound or close to [[soil organic matter]]. Soil [[microorganism]] will usually convert organic nitrogen into mineral nitrogen for plants.

Noteworthy elements in soil obstructing root exploration : rocks, [[tillage]] sole, [[water table]] (nappe phreatique) inducing O2 scarcity.
Plants compete for resources, but also compliment each other ([[facilitation]], [[symbiosis]]).

Roots grow at their apex, and have high exsudation at these locations. 
## Biomass
Plant below ground [[biomass]] is 40% of of total plant biomass (20-80%), highly variable depending on the species, [[soil type]] and environmental conditions (the plant will not put energy in roots if there is no need for nutrients due to mineral fertilisation). The plant will put energy in the most effective compartments, based on what limits its growth the most. When plants need energy (light and carbon) they grow leaf, if they need nutrient and water, they grow roots. But they always need leaf t Matières organiques des sols et services écosystémiques<br>[[Chevallier2025_OrganicMatters]]<br>]]iphaine Chevallier (IRD)_ ere_plant_biomass.png|600]]

Most of soil biomass is [[rhizodeposition]]. But most plant biomass is above ground. But my assumption is that litter is incorporated in soil with a lower efficiency, as there are more intermediate organisms mineralizing the biomass. See [[Chevallier2025_OrganicMatters]].

## Symbiosis
Plants can perform [[symbiosis|symbiotic relationship]] with bacteria, forming [[nodules]], and fungi, forming [[mycorrhiza]]s.

Roots do not merge with other roots (organism exclusive). Some woody plants can have connecting roots (information sharing), or connect via ]]rhizes.
# Rhizosphere observations
Studying roots is done by: 
- digging a trench and looking at a profile. One can put a grid and count root per grid cell to get densities. This is time consuming.
- harvesting a portion of soil and running it in a medical scanner (expensive and scarce)
- use radars on soil (only top cm)
- look with buried scanner ([[Hedde, Mickael]])

# Ecological functions
The rhizosphere is a hotspot of [[soil biodiversity|soil biodiversity]] and is key in [[plant health]].

An important process occuring in this ecosystem is [[biological nitrogen fixation]]. Bacteria fix atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia, and archae transform ammonia into nitrate.
