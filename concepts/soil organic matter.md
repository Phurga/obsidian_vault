**Soil organic matter (SOM)** is the organic component of [[soil]] matter. **Soil organic carbon (SOC)** is the carbon part of SOM, and SOC is in average 58% of SOM [[Trivedi2018_Chapter1]].

SOM is effectively constituted of living biomass of microorganisms, including plants, recovered dead organisms tissues and excretions, but not surface detritus ([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil_organic_matter#)). Most of SOM is matter bound to mineral as part of mineral associated organic matter (MAOM, see [[soil aggregate]]) or as particulate organic matter (POM) ([[Cotrufo2022_ChapterOne]]). A fraction of SOM is not solid but solubilised in the liquid phase of soil, or as volatile compounds in the gaseous phase. 

Soil organic carbon stocks on earth represents 1700 GtC and is the most important terrestrial stock of carbon [[Friedlingstein2024_GlobalCarbon]].
# SOM composition
Organic matter is usually considered to be composed of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur (CHONPS).

SOC is a resource for soil organisms and also the soil organisms ([[biomass]]). Carbon is used by organisms as an energy source (sugars) and also as a structural element (squeleton, tissues etc).

Soils store more carbon when healthy. Soils will release carbon if harmed as soil living biomass decrease (linked with [[climate change]]). The collective carbon content of all soil bacterial cells is comparable to that of all plants on earth [[FAO2020_Stateknowledge]] (see [[biomass]]).
# SOC stability
SOM degrades over time as it is consumed by organisms and a fraction is returned to the atmosphere via organisms [[respiration]]. [[soil macrofauna]] performs coarse plant fragmentation, [[soil mesofauna]] fine fragmentation, [[microorganism]] perform decomposition (chemical action, not just physical).

But not all original SOM is respired and a fraction is incorporated into the soil for medium or long term. A fraction is either complex molecules that take decades to be metabolized into simpler molecules, another fraction is stabilized into clays as [[soil aggregate|aggregates]]. These molecules or aggregates tend to be burried down over time, leading to increasingly older carbon with depth. This long term fraction thus provides a pool of nutrient to be use on a medium term, providing resilience to ecosystems. Also this spreads the delivery of nutrient over time leading to better assimilation by plants.

**Soil organic matter can be available** to living organisms or not. The available part is also named "**labile**" fraction. It can be absorbed by organisms (microorganisms for instance). A fraction cannot be absorbed, the **stabilized** part, it is surrounded by [[clay]] particles. 
Some organic compounds are too complex to be metabolized by organisms and are retained in soils for decades.

[[earthworms]] or other [[ecosystem engineer]] can disturb stabilized [[soil organic matter]] pockets, cycling them back to the [[ecosystem]].
# SOM as an indicator
High SOM concentrations are correlated with positive characteristics of soil quality, see [[LCIA method on soil quality]].
Outside of LCIA, correlation with generic characteristics include:
- improved [[soil structure]] and thus reduced erosion, improve water permeability,
- increased fertility (from increase nutrient availability),
- increased biomass and thus populations (warning: this can be false positives since SOM can be unavailable to organisms),
- pollution retention.

However it is difficult to use SOC as an indicator to discriminate [[agricultural practices]] (not done in [[DeLaurentiis2024_Soilorganic]])
> Specific soil management options such as organic agriculture or conservation agriculture, are not distinguished in the CFs developed here. (...) The CFs provided so far cannot support comparisons with conventional agriculture.

# SOC ranges
A typical SOC concentration in France is 50 tC per hectare [[Chevallier2025_Organicmatters]].
This value depends on the type of soil and agricultural practice [[Basile-Doelsch2020_Reviewssyntheses]], [fujisaki 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016706117312156#f0015)
Also depends on hydromorphy (swamps are in anaerobic conditions and prevent organic matter decomposition leading to accumulation).

Example ranges for main soil classes [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil_organic_matter#):

| SOC range | soil type        |
| --------- | ---------------- |
| <1%       | desert           |
| 1 to 6%   | mineral topsoils |
| 6 to 12%  | ?                |
| 12 to 18% | organic soils    |

## SOC dynamics
SOM dynamics depend on C input and C outputs. C outputs are difficult to tackle in agriculture so farmers focus on C inputs. Limiting C outputs is mostly reducing biomass exports. An important factor of C loss is organisms respiration (mineralisation of C into the atmosphere).
Increasing SOC is a slow process, considering an efficient storage at **1 tC per year**. Storage is conditioned to maintaining a storing practice, and induces reaching a new C equilibrium. If the practice is stopped, a new (lower) equilibrium will be found. The practice must be maintained.
Organic amendmends are the most effective way to increase SOC. [[IPCC2019_2019Refinement]] indicates that stopping tillage is the most effective but there is a calculation error (considering constant soil density while tilled soil is more dense hence changing results). See 4 pour 1000 report.
# Measuring SOM or SOC
SOC is easier to measure than SOM, so we usually measure SOC and estimate SOM from this.
SOC can be measured through direct measures of soil samples (requires sampling procedures) using the CHN method.
SOC can be measured through indirect measures through spectrometry and remote sensing. Spectrometry still is not super accurate but provides a good basis (still requires lots of field samples for calibration).
