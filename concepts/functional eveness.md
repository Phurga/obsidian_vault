Describes the regularity of the abundance distribution within the filled space. It relates to over- or underutilization of resources, and is hence an early warning signal of changes in community composition. [[Mason2005_Functionalrichness]]

High FDe does not mean that many niches are filled (ie does not mean that the niche space is densely filled) only that the species are spread evenly in the niche space.
