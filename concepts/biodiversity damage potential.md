The **biodiversity damage potential (BDP)** is [[LCIA method for land use impacts on ecosystem quality]] method detailed in [[DeBaan2013_Landuse]].
It does not use [[species-area-relationship|SAR]] but only empirical measurements, mainly based on [[GLOBIO]].
The recommended metric is [[relative species loss|PDF]] but others are available due to the nature of the background data, can be [[mean species abundance|MSA]], [[shannon index]] and others.
