**Soils are never "dead"**. Many microorganisms are [[dormancy|dormant]] and will be reactivated when favourable conditions are found. Note that this is tricky to verify because most organic matter inputs contain alien organisms.
This dormancy induces that there can be strong reductions in [[biological activity]] but not strong reductions in [[species abudance]] or [[species richness]]. However population reductions are often found.
