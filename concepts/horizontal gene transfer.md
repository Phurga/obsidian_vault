**Horizontal gene transfer** is the process by which an organism can express genetic information without reproduction (i.e. vertical transfer). Horizontal mostly occurs in [[prokaryote]]s. A gene is transferred inside a new host cell either directly ([[DNA]]) or indirectly ([[RNA]]). This occurs via several mechanisms, such as via viruses, plasmids or other vectors.
