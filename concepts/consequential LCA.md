**Consequential life cycle assessment** is an alternative to the dominant approach to [[LCA|life cycle assessement]], attributional LCA.

Attributional LCA aims at estimating the impacts of a product based on a value chain responsibility paradigm. If one considers the total impacts of the global economy, attributional LCA will attempt to attribute a share of these impacts to the studied system based on direct relationships with the system (with allocation rules for multifunctional processes). For this reason attributional LCA is widespread in contexts where the goal is to measure and attribute impacts to a product or an organisation, i.e. environmental footprinting.
Consequential LCA aims at estimating the change in impacts derived from a decision. The decision being for instance the use of a specific (new) product. It would not only consider the production impacts of the product, but also side effects related to the introduction of the product. Important side effects are market effects: increased production of product A might lead to decreased production of product B, or induce rebound effects increasing consumption of A or a third linked product C. For instance in [[Schmidt2015_Lifecycle]], esp. section 2.3.

Properly defined in [[Sonnemann2011_Globalguidance]]:
- Attributional approach: System modelling approach in which inputs and outputs are attributed to the functional unit of a product system by linking and/or partitioning the unit processes of the system according to a normative rule. 
- Consequential approach: System modelling approach in which activities in a product system are linked so that activities are included in the product system to the extent that they are expected to change as a consequence of a change in demand for the functional unit.

Consequential LCA tries to solve the issue of the normative partitioning of multifunctional processes (through elaborate system expansion) and integrate side effects such as rebound effects towards results that are closer to the socio economic context of the study. They are best used when trying to answer a question such as "what is the effect of increasing the consumption of x ?"

Marginal consequential LCA vs incremental consequential LCA: by default consequential LCA are marginal, meaning that they account for small changes of markets (eg substitution of a product leads solely to the decrease in production of the substituted product). Incremental LCA stand for large scale changes where the whole economy is affected, leading to increased changes. Modeling choices are in this case different.

In brief, in my understanding, consequential LCA are most appropriate to study the effect of a decision, implying a transitional state, and thus has a temporal validity, while attributional LCA are more appropriate to study a system at equilibrium and estimating impacts based on an existing socioeconomic system. In many cases, attributional LCAs are used as a tool to supporting decisions affecting the future state of the economy, where consequential would be better suited for.
