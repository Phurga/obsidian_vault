**Consequential life cycle assessment** is an alternative to the dominant approach to [[life cycle assessment|life cycle assessement]], attributional LCA.

In brief, in my understanding, consequential LCA are most appropriate to study the effect of a decision, implying a transitional state, and thus has a temporal validity, while attributional LCA are more appropriate to study a system at equilibrium and estimating impacts based on an existing socioeconomic system. In many cases, attributional LCAs are used as a tool to supporting decisions affecting the future state of the economy, where consequential would be better suited for.
