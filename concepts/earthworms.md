**Earthworms (Lumbricinae)** are worms living in the [[soil]]. They are part of the **oligochaete** subclass, **annelids** phylum, and are considered [[invertebrate]]s.

Earthworms are [[detritivore]]s, eating dead organic matter in the [[litter]] or inside the soil, and [[microorganism|microbes]] such as [[fungus]] and [[bacteria]] in the process. They are [[ecosystem engineer]], moving the equivalent of up to 10 cm of soil each year (bioturbation). They have a great influence on [[soil structure]] through [[soil aggregate]] formation leading to soil porosity. 

Earthworms is an important source of biomass is 2 tons per ha, half the biomass of [[fungus]] and [[bacteria]].

## Ecological functions
Earthworms not only move soil but also modify it by digesting it. The digestive system of worms is a medium where microbes transform organic matter and mix it to the soil, to get energy for the worm and the microbes, and also to excrete casts, a mix of soil and other worm induced microorganisms. Worms benefit from the energy during the digestion but also create their own [[biotope|habitat]].

In the short term, worm casts slow down organic matter [[mineralization]] by protecting it by a layer of mucus, making it more accessible to other organisms ([[carbon transformation]]). Earthworms presence increase soil productivity, +25% average yields [[vanGroenigen2014_Earthwormsincrease]].  Earthworm activity and effect is improved with increased crop residue and reduced mineral fertilisation.

Worms increase [[nutrient cycling]] and transform organic material into mineral nitrogen (ammonia, nitrates). Worm casts is much more fertile than average soil [[Vos2019_Largevariations]]. There is an increased C concentration surrounding earthworms galeries (vs soil bulk): through excrements and mucus secretion stimulating local activity.

There is a coincidence between the apparition of earthworms and fertile soils, but no causality established. There was no earthworms in northern american ecosystems until we introduced them, and still there were fertile ecosystems (meadows).

Anecic worms incorporate litter into the soil. Endogeic worms disperse SOM into the soil. They also have strong soil structure effects (decompaction, galeries for soil infiltration).

Earthworms are not such as great bioindicator. [[Hedde2025_Diversityroles]]
## Classification
There are 6000 described [[species]] of earthworms, that can be classified by their functional traits (or by ecological categories by [[Bouché, Marcel]]). It is especially challenging to classify earthworms species since they have little anatomical 

Earthworms body is a succession of segments (rings), they produce mucus in their clitellum, reproduce with eggs.

| Burrower            | Epi-anecic          | Large (15 cm)   | From surface to 1 m              | Feeds and middens on the surface, Y shaped tunnels down to 1 m.          |
| Little dweller      | [[epigeic]]         | Small (5 cm)    | Litter                           | Feeds and casts on the surface, stays outside except to avoid pressures. |
| Shallow bioturbator | Epi-endogeic        | Medium (7.5 cm) | Litter and shallow soil (<15 cm) | Feeds on litter. Refills burrows with casts, disconnecting from surface. |
| Deep bioturbator    | Hypo-[[endogeic]]   | Large (10 cm)   | Subsoil (>15 cm)                 | Stays in the ground. Refills burrows with casts.                         |
| Intense tunneler    | Anecic              | Large (20cm)    | From surface to 2 m              | Feeds and casts on the surface. Digs deep vertical burrows.              |
| Intermediate groups | NA                  | NA              | NA                               | NA, does not fit the current classification.                             |

## Trivia
Earthworms species diversity is higher in the south because the north was frozen in the previous glacial era and earthworms had to recolonize to the north (slow process).
