**Land management** is the set of **practices** performed on land under a given [[land use]].

Under the same land use, it is sometimes important to discriminate for different **land management regimes**, since different regimes have different intensity levels (see [[land use intensity]]), correlated with environmental impacts.
## sustainable land management
**Sustainable land management** corresponds to using a set of practices balancing human needs and environmental limits, allowing for the renewal of the ecosystem productive potential and environmental functions. See [FAO](https://www.fao.org/land-water/land/sustainable-land-management/en/)
