**Life cycle assessment (LCA)** is a framework to assess the environmental impacts of a system across its life cycle, i.e. not only during its use stage but before and after (production and end of life).

It is defined in the ISO 14040 and ISO 14044 norms ([[ISO2006_ISO14044]], [[ISO2006_ISO14040]]).

The three pillars of life cycle assessment are:
- multicriterion (accounting for multiple environmental impact categories)
- multistage (accounting for all stages in the life cycle of the system)
- use of a **functional unit** (to allow for relevant comparisons across different systems)

The main stages of an LCA study consist in:
- the definition of the study goals and context, including the definition of the system model studied.
- establishing the [[LCI|life cycle inventory]]
- performing the [[LCIA|life cycle impact assessment]]
- interpreting the results, and gradually refining the results based on the latest obtained results, focusing data collection and interpretation efforts on the most relevant parts of the model
