Occupancy abundance relationship is a well documented relationship linking the potential habitat area of a specie with its abundance.
It is similar to the [[species-area relationship]] but for the abundance.
See [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupancy%E2%80%93abundance_relationship).

#concept/idea merge this relationship with the SAR relationship to get a modeled MSA relationship ? Maybe it needs more data like HSM.
#concept/idea this could be used to transform the vulnerability into a continuous function expanded to all species.
#concept/idea this could be used to link with the below 500 population risk for extinction
