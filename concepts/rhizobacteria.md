**Rhizobacteria** are [[bacteria]] creating a mutualistic [[biological interaction]] with some [[fabacae]] (legumes). The bacteria will fix atmospheric nitrogen (N2(g)) into nodules through the process of [[biological nitrogen fixation|nitrogen]]. The fixed nitrogen, a scarce nutrient for the plant, is then at disposal of the plant for its growth. The plant will host the bacteria and provide it with sugars, source of energy.

The plant and bacteria establish a chemical dialog to enable the symbiosis: the plant can refuse the symbiosis if it does not need it. The bacteria needs to plant to live.
