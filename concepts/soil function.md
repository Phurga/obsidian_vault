A **soil function** is an assembly of *properties and biochemical processes* enabling the soil to function properly (i.e. to deliver ecosystem services).

![[Banwart2019_SoilFunctions#critical zone]]

[[INRAE2025_PreserverQualite]] defines 8 soil functions:
- maintain [[soil structure]],
- support [[biodiversity]] (below and above ground),
- regulate water,
- regulate contaminants (pollution),
- supply nutrients to biocenosis ([[nutrient cycling]]),
- store carbon ([[carbon transformation]]).

[[Kibblewhite2007_Soilhealth]] used to define 4 of them:
- [[carbon transformation]],
- [[nutrient cycling]],
- [[soil structure]],
- [[biological regulation]].
## soil function vs soil service
Soil functions enable [[soil ecosystem service|soil services]] ([[INRAE2025_PreserverQualite]]).

Alternatively, in ([[FAO2020_StateKnowledge]] pp115): 
> Functions refer to natural-biological processes, while services refer to those functions that contribute to human well-being.
