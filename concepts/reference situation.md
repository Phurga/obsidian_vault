In [[life cycle assessment]], impact on [[biodiversity]] is usually measured relative to a **reference situation**. The choice of the reference situation is important and will affect the results.

[[Vrasdonk2019_ReferenceSituations]] defines different types of reference situations:
- **reference situation**: any situation against which we can quantitatively compare another situation.
- **baseline reference situations**: past situation for an original, unmanaged, state. This definition is too broad and leads to issues because of indirect human pressures such as global climate change or livestock presence. 
	- **natural counterfactual**: past hypothetical situation that would have occurred nowadays without human interventions in the past.
	- **re-naturalization**, or "natural regeneration" : future hypothetical state after all human interventions had stopped. Identified as the most suitable reference for attributional LCAs. Ignores irreversible impacts. Potential natural vegetation is a common re-naturalization reference situation.
	- **target** : used in conservation policies, state at which to aim, given ecological needs and socioeconomic and political possibilities. Target references can favour not only naturalness but specific semi-natural environments with important socioeconomical or cultural value, accounting for long-term human occupancy rather than (supposedly) pristine landscapes. 
		- Example : semi-open ecosystems, created by burning and maintained by grazing, host a rich but different biodiversity than that found in a climax ecosystem (usually forests), leading to increased species richness at regional scale.
- **limit reference situations** : used in conservation policies, this does not represent a natural state, but indicate that the system or object will be subject to serious or irreversible harm when the limit is exceeded.
	- #todo/question i'm not sure I understand this one. Example are given with conservation policies focusing on carnivorous mammals.

Examples:
- [[relative species loss]] (natural counterfactual #todo/notsure )
- [[biodiversity value increment]] (natural counterfactual #todo/notsure )

Attributional and consequential LCAs use different reference states. #todo/refneeded 

Challenges in the practical definition of a reference situation:
- absence of historical records for counterfactual situations
- absence of equivalent pristine states with equivalent ecological conditions, leading to using semi-natural sites as reference situations: use of "best-available condition" or "least-disturbed condition".

[[Vrasdonk2019_ReferenceSituations]] promotes target reference situations. Following the idea that [[monitoring the advancement of conservation policies is the main goal of biodiversity LCIA]].
