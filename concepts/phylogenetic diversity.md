**Phylogenetic diversity** represents how different [[taxonomy]] are based on their common ancestors. High [[taxonomy|phylogeny]] diversity involves numerous branches in the evolutionary tree with long period of times between branches. It is used in [[life cycle impact assessment]], see [[loss of years of evolutionary history]].

> It has been argued that the biodiversity value of  a region is better estimated by the amount of phylogenetic diversity  hosted by it rather than just its species richness (see, e.g., Crozier,  1997; Faith, 1992; Jetz et al., 2014; Mace, Gittleman, & Purvis, 2003;  Safi, Armour-Marshall, Baillie, & Isaac, 2013). The main argument  here is that the PD in a region measures the evolutionary information within its flora/fauna, and more PD offers the region both more  functional diversity (and so, e.g., more resilience) and more options to  respond to a changing world (see, e.g., Collen et al., 2011; Mace et al.,  2003).
