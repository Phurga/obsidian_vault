**Species richness** is a metric used to represent the amount of different [[taxonomy]] in an [[ecosystem]]. It is a [[compositional diversity]] indicator.

Note: [[species diversity]] is different from species richness: diversity indices account for both richness and abundance to derive compositional similarity indices.
