**Species richness** is a metric used to represent the amount of different [[taxonomy|species]] in an [[ecosystem]]. Richness can be assessed at local or regional level, yielding different results (see [[measures of biodiversity]]).

Note: [[species diversity]] is different from species richness: diversity indices account for both richness and abundance to derive compositional similarity indices.
