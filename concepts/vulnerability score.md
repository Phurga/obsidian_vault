The **vulnerability score (VS)** is a method to convert a regional [[relative species loss]] into a global [[relative species loss]], ie accounting for [[species extinction risk]], defined in [[Chaudhary2015_QuantifyingLand]].

The vulnerability score is based on:
- the original regional [[species richness]]
- the regional [[endemic richness]], itself based on the geographic range of species
- the [[IUCN red ist of threatened species|IUCN threat level]] of species

This score is calculated for a given taxon in a given ecoregion.

Main data source are :
- the [[IUCN red ist of threatened species]] for species geographic coverage and threat levels.
- [[Kier2005_Globalpatterns]] for plants species richness
- [WWF wildfinder](https://www.worldwildlife.org/pages/wildfinder) for other taxon species richness (now out of order and most likely replaced by IUCN)

> The regional CFs derived in the preceding section (eqs 1−7) give an estimate of regional species loss per unit of land use and land use change. However, if the species are endemic to the ecoregion, their loss will translate into global species loss (extinction). To determine an estimate of the permanent global (irreversible) species loss, the regional CFs for each taxon g per ecoregion j are multiplied by a vulnerability score (VSg,j) of that taxon in that ecoregion. For the VS, we first calculate “endemic richness (ERg,j)” of each taxon g per ecoregion j using the definition of Kier et al. 40,41 by summing the range fractions of all species within the ecoregion: ∑= = ER GR GR g j k m k g j k g , 1 , , , (8) where m = Sorg,g,j is the total number of species of taxa g found within ecoregion j, GRk,g,j (in square kilometers) is the portion of geographic range of species k inside ecoregion j, and GRk,g is the total (global) geographic range of species k (in square kilometers). The endemic richness of a region can be interpreted as the specific contribution of the region to global biodiversity. 41 Following Verones et al., 42 we then multiplied the range fraction of each species with its IUCN 43 assigned threat level (TL) to calculate the “threatened endemic richness (TER)” per taxa in each ecoregion. The vulnerability score (VS) is now defined as the ratio of “threatened endemic richness (TERg,j)” to total species richness: = = ∑ = ∑ = = S S S VS TER TL ER g j g j g j k m k g k g j g j k m g j , , org, , 1 , , , org, , 1 TL GR GR org, , k g k g j k g , , , , (9) The CFs giving a measure of global species loss (called global CFs hereafter) are then calculated by simply multiplying regional CFs by the VS of the corresponding taxon and ecoregion: =CF CF VSg i j g i j g jglobal, , , regional, , , , (10)
