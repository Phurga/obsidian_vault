**Soil biological diversity** refers to [[biodiversity]] inside the [[soil]].

The diversity of organisms in soil is fostered by the diversity in [[biotope|habitat]] inside the hierarchical structure of [[soil aggregate|soil organo-mineral aggregate]]s. Diversity is also boosted by the oligotrophic nature of soil (food scarce) leading to important organisms specialisation.

An organism is considered a soil organism if it spends at least one active stage of its life cycle in the soil ([[Marsden2025_Introductionsoil]]). Insects can have passive or active soil larvae, defining if they are classified as soil organisms or not.

Soil likely hosts 60% of global species [[Anthony2023_EnumeratingSoil]].

## organisms classification
### taxonomic and morphological classification
List of the main taxon present in the soil are the following, usually classified by size groups (morphology):
- [[microorganism]]
	- [[bacteria]] and [[archae]],
	- [[fungus]],
	- [[protist|protists]] ([[algae]] and [[protozoae]])
	- [[virus]],
- soil fauna
	- microfauna, mainly [[nematode]], [[tardigrade]]
	- mesofauna, mainly [[soil microarthropod]]
	- macrofauna
		- [[soil macroarthropod]],
		- [[earthworm]],
	- megafauna, mainly [[soil vertebrate]],
- plant, via their roots and the [[rhizosphere]].

> Soil communities are hierarchical systems where various types of organisms populate critically different volumes of soil. This includes the micrometre-thick water film around soil particles that house aquatic organisms like bacteria, protists, nematodes and tardigrades (that is, the microfauna), the air-filled pore space for soil animals between 100 Î¼m and 2 mm width (that is, the mesofauna), the hot-spots of nutrients and other resources around plant roots for microorganisms, and the macrofauna and megafauna that perceive soil as a whole in which they make passages that can penetrate all soil horizons across significant soil volumes (Pokarzhevskii et al., 2003). The main driving force of the high diversity of soil animals is this body size fractionation, but also their functional differentiation (Figure 2.2.1, and Figure 2.2.2). A variety of ecological niches in the soil, both in terms of size and in the range of resources provided, leads to a significant functional differentiation of soil organisms.
### trophic groups
The [[soil food web]] is a simplified model capturing soil biodiversity composition and structure, through its trophic chains.
Trophic groups are for instance [[autotroph]], [[herbivores]], [[predators]] etc, see [[food web]]. There can be combined classfications among trophic groups and taxon (e.g. herbivore nematodes)
### functional roles
Organisms can be classified based on their main functional roles (besides the position in the trophic chain). These groups include:
- [[ecosystem engineer]], with large scales effects on the soil structure,
- [[litter transformer]], digesting plant and animal litter and incorporating it in the soil,
- the [[microfood web]], made of [[microorganism]] and [[microfauna]].

## soil organisms observation
Soil organisms identification is challenging (opaque medium, microorganisms, deep and heterogeneous medium). 
Species identification and classification was historically challenging. Today, new techniques are invented to detect more animals, such as in [[situ soil imaging]] or environmental [[DNA metabarcoding]].
