**Soil biological diversity** refers to [[biodiversity]] inside the [[soil]].

The diversity of organisms in soil is fostered by the diversity in [[biotope|habitat]] inside the hierarchical structure of [[soil aggregate|soil organo-mineral aggregate]]s. Diversity is also boosted by the oligotrophic nature of soil (food scarce) leading to important organisms specialisation.

An organism is considered a soil organism if it spends at least one active stage of its life cycle in the soil ([[Marsden2025_Introductionsoil]]). Insects can have passive or active soil larvae, defining if they are classified as soil organisms or not.

Soil likely hosts 60% of global species [[Anthony2023_Enumeratingsoil]].

[[FAO2020_Stateknowledge]]
> - 1 gram of soil contains up to 1 billion bacteria cells, comprising tens of thousands of taxa, up to 200 metres of fungal hyphae, and a wide range of organisms including nematodes, earthworms and arthropods.
> - More than 40% of living organisms in terrestrial ecosystems are associated during their life-cycle directly with soils (Decaëns et al., 2006). In fact, soils are one of the main global reservoirs of biodiversity (Bardgett and van der Putten, 2014; Carey, 2016).

> Soil communities are hierarchical systems where various types of organisms populate critically different volumes of soil. This includes the micrometre-thick water film around soil particles that house aquatic organisms like bacteria, protists, nematodes and tardigrades (that is, the microfauna), the air-filled pore space for soil animals between 100 μm and 2 mm width (that is, the mesofauna), the hot-spots of nutrients and other resources around plant roots for microorganisms, and the macrofauna and megafauna that perceive soil as a whole in which they make passages that can penetrate all soil horizons across significant soil volumes (Pokarzhevskii et al., 2003). The main driving force of the high diversity of soil animals is this body size fractionation, but also their functional differentiation (Figure 2.2.1, and Figure 2.2.2). A variety of ecological niches in the soil, both in terms of size and in the range of resources provided, leads to a significant functional differentiation of soil organisms.

### trophic groups
The [[soil food web]] is a simplified model capturing soil biodiversity composition and structure, through its trophic chains.
Trophic groups are for instance [[autotroph]], [[herbivores]], [[predators]] etc, see [[food web]]. There can be combined classfications among trophic groups and taxon (e.g. herbivore nematodes)
### functional roles
Organisms can be classified based on their main functional roles (besides the position in the trophic chain). These groups include:
- [[ecosystem engineer]], with large scales effects on the soil structure,
- [[litter transformer]], digesting plant and animal litter and incorporating it in the soil,
- the [[microfood web]], made of [[microorganism]] and [[microfauna]].

## soil organisms observation
Soil organisms identification is challenging (opaque medium, microorganisms, deep and heterogeneous medium). 

Species identification and classification was historically challenging. Today, new techniques are invented to detect more animals, such as in [[situ soil imaging]] or environmental [[DNA metabarcoding]].
## explaining the hyperdiverse nature of soils, gemini
Soils are often referred to as a "hyperdiverse habitat" because they harbor an astonishing variety of life, often exceeding the biodiversity found in aboveground ecosystems like rainforests.1 Recent estimates suggest that almost 60% of all species on Earth can be found within the soil. This immense biodiversity is not haphazard; it's intricately organized both spatially and temporally.

Here's why soils are so hyperdiverse and how this biodiversity is organized:

### Why Soils are a Hyperdiverse Habitat:

1. Extreme Spatial Heterogeneity (Microhabitats within Microhabitats):
    
    - Physical Structure: Soil is a complex three-dimensional matrix of solid particles (sand, silt, clay), pores (filled with air or water), and organic matter.2 This creates an incredible diversity of physical microhabitats, each with unique conditions (e.g., oxygen levels, moisture, temperature).
        
    - Pore Spaces: Different pore sizes and connectivity create distinct niches.3 Microbes thrive in water films around particles, while larger organisms (e.g., nematodes, mites) navigate through interconnected pore networks.4
        
    - Chemical Gradients: Within even a few millimeters, there can be steep gradients in pH, nutrient availability (nitrogen, phosphorus), carbon sources, and redox potential (oxygen levels). This allows for a vast array of organisms with different metabolic requirements to coexist.
    - Organic Matter Patches: Organic matter inputs (dead leaves, roots, animal remains) are not evenly distributed. These discrete patches provide concentrated food sources and distinct microclimates, attracting specific decomposers and their associated food webs.
    - Rhizosphere and Detritusphere: The area immediately surrounding plant roots (rhizosphere) is a hotbed of microbial activity due to root exudates.5 Similarly, decaying organic matter creates "hotspots" of decomposition (detritusphere). These dynamic interfaces support specialized communities.
        
2. Diverse Resource Availability:
    
    - Soils contain a continuous spectrum of organic compounds, from simple sugars to complex polymers like cellulose and lignin.6 This provides a vast buffet for decomposers, and different organisms specialize in breaking down specific compounds.
        
    - The constant input of fresh organic matter from plants and animals ensures a continuous supply of energy and nutrients, supporting complex food webs.7
        
3. High Connectivity and Interactions:
    
    - Despite their small size, soil organisms form intricate food webs.8 The interactions (predation, competition, mutualism, parasitism) between bacteria, fungi, protozoa, nematodes, arthropods, and larger fauna create a dynamic system that fosters diversity.9 For example, some fungi form symbiotic relationships with plant roots (mycorrhizae), significantly increasing the diversity of both belowground and aboveground life.10
        
4. Long Evolutionary History and Isolation:
    
    - Soils have been a habitat for life for billions of years, providing ample time for evolutionary diversification.
    - The fragmented nature of soil habitats can lead to localized evolution and speciation, further increasing global diversity.11
        
5. Variability in Abiotic Factors:
    
    - Factors like soil texture, pH, temperature, and moisture content vary significantly across landscapes and even within a single soil profile. Each combination of these factors can select for a unique community of organisms.

### Spatial Organization of Soil Biodiversity:

Soil biodiversity is organized across multiple spatial scales:

1. Microscale (Micrometers to Millimeters):
    
    - Pore-scale heterogeneity: Different organisms occupy different pore sizes and water films.12 Bacteria and archaea thrive in water-filled pores and on particle surfaces.13
        
    - Micro-aggregates: Soil particles clump together to form aggregates, creating internal microhabitats with different aeration, moisture, and organic matter content, each supporting distinct microbial communities.14
        
    - Rhizosphere: The thin layer of soil directly influenced by plant roots is a zone of intense activity.15 Root exudates attract specific bacteria and fungi, leading to a unique and often more diverse community compared to bulk soil.16
        
    - Detritusphere/Hotspots: Decomposing litter and dead roots create localized "hotspots" of nutrient and carbon availability, supporting highly active and specialized microbial communities.17
        
2. Mesoscale (Centimeters to Meters):
    
    - Vertical Stratification: Soil profiles have distinct layers (horizons) with varying organic matter content, compaction, moisture, and oxygen levels.18
        
        - O horizon (organic layer): Rich in fresh litter, supporting fungi, litter-dwelling arthropods (mites, springtails), and earthworms.19
            
        - A horizon (topsoil): High organic matter, abundant microbial life, roots, and burrowing invertebrates.
        - Deeper horizons: Tend to be more mineral, with lower organic matter and oxygen, favoring anaerobic microbes and deep-rooting organisms.
    - Plant-driven patterns: Different plant species or plant functional types (e.g., trees vs. grasses) create distinct belowground environments due to differences in root architecture, exudates, and litter quality, influencing the composition of soil communities beneath them.
    - Burrows and channels: Earthworms, termites, and other larger soil fauna create extensive burrow systems that alter soil structure, aeration, and water flow, creating new microhabitats and pathways for other organisms.20
        
3. Macroscale (Meters to Kilometers/Global):
    
    - Landscape patterns: Climate, topography, vegetation type, and land use practices (agriculture, forestry) influence soil properties (pH, texture, organic carbon) at broader scales, leading to distinct soil communities across regions.
    - Biogeographic patterns: Similar to aboveground ecosystems, soil biodiversity exhibits global biogeographic patterns, with certain groups being more prevalent in specific climatic zones or soil types.

### Temporal Organization of Soil Biodiversity:

Soil biodiversity is also highly dynamic over time, responding to various drivers:21

1. Diel (Daily) Cycles:
    
    - Fluctuations in temperature and moisture influence the activity of many soil organisms.22 For example, some microbes may become more active during warmer periods or after rewetting events.23
        
2. Seasonal Cycles:
    
    - Plant growth cycles: The availability of root exudates and fresh litter varies seasonally.24 Microbial communities in the rhizosphere peak during periods of active plant growth, while decomposer activity often increases in autumn with leaf fall.
        
    - Temperature and moisture: Freezing and thawing cycles, as well as wet and dry seasons, dramatically alter soil conditions, leading to shifts in community composition and activity. For example, fungal communities may dominate in drier periods, while bacteria thrive when moisture is abundant.
    - Life cycles of soil fauna: Many invertebrates have seasonal life cycles, with populations peaking at certain times of the year (e.g., emergence of insect larvae).
3. Successional Changes (Ecological Time):
    
    - Primary succession: Over long periods (hundreds to thousands of years), as soils develop from bare rock, pioneering organisms gradually modify the environment, allowing for the establishment of more complex and diverse communities.25
        
    - Secondary succession: After disturbances (e.g., fire, clear-cutting, agricultural abandonment), soil communities undergo successional changes as the ecosystem recovers, often returning to a state of higher diversity over time.
4. Disturbance and Recovery:
    
    - Natural disturbances: Floods, droughts, fires, and pest outbreaks can temporarily reduce biodiversity, but resilient communities often recover, sometimes with shifts in species dominance.
    - Anthropogenic disturbances: Tillage, chemical inputs (fertilizers, pesticides), and pollution can have profound and often long-lasting impacts on soil biodiversity, leading to significant losses or shifts towards less diverse, more resilient communities. Recovery from severe human disturbance can take decades or even centuries.26
        

In essence, the soil's incredible complexity and dynamism, coupled with its role as the foundation for terrestrial life, make it a unparalleled reservoir of biodiversity, intricately structured both in space and time to fulfill its critical ecosystem functions.
