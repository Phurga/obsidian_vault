**Termites** are [[eusocial]] [[soil macroarthropod]], especially present in tropical, subtropical or semi-arid regions. Termites feed on [[cellulose]] contained in [[soil organic matter]] (can be living plants or litter and humus) from various sources, and host a variety of [[microorganism|microbial]] communities depending on their alimentation. They can be classified into:
- wood feeder
- soil feeder
- foragers (interface soil-wood)
- mushroom growers ([[symbiosis]] with [[fungus|fungus]] to digest wood, termites give wooden debris to a fungus that predigests it).

Termites can improve [[nutrient cycling]] and are important [[ecosystem engineer]] as they build galleries and nests, leading to [[soil decompaction]] (better aeration, drainage, root penetration).

Termites are seen as invasive for [[agricultural systems]], and are difficult to eliminate since they live inside soils, away from pesticides and predators. Termites can be controlled with parasites such as [[fungus]], [[mite]] or [[nematode]].

Termites can build wide nests with massive aboveground mounds.
