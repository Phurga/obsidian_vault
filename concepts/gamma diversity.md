**Gamma diversity** corresponds to the total [[species richness]] found in a region, such as an ecoregion or a country.

It is difficult to measure empirically and is generally the result of an extrapolation using a model, such as [[species distribution model]]s or the [[species-area relationship]].

Thus this value is most representative of species richness when communicating results and using values for [[life cycle assessment]].
