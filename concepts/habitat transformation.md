**Habitat transformation** refers to the transformation of a local [[biotope]], habitat to native species, leading to its degradation (from the native species perspective). 

The transformed space becomes unsuitable to host viable populations of some species, which then disappear ([[extinction|local extinction]]). a suboptimal habitat for many native organisms.
## land use change
**Land use change** is an anthropocentric way of considering habitat transformation.
## impact pathway for biodiversity
Habitat transformation is one of the 5 [[main pressures on biodiversity]].
Local species are adapted to a local stable biotope, constituting an [[ecosystem]]. Each specie and organism will occupy their own [[biotope|ecological niche]]. External pressures can transform the natural [[biotope]], leading to an unstable ecosystem. This new biotope will see its biocenose reach a the new stable composition after some time, with changes in organisms composition and interactions. Species that cannot adapt to the new biotope will locally disappear. Species whose ecological niche is still part of this new biotope will maintain a sustainable population. 
Note that disappeared species do not always have had all their organisms die. Organisms can be displaced given their mobility allows for it. [[Habitat fragmentation]] makes this displacement more challenging and increase the risk of population decreases at regional levels.

Transformation of a plot of land from a given [[land use]] class to another land use class. This transformation is considered to have temporary effects, calculated as the loss of quality over the regeneration time of the [[ecosystem]] once the land returns to a natural state after the considered land use. Permanent effects (irreversibility of damages) can also be considered, ie the land will never come back to its original quality levels even after regeneration.
