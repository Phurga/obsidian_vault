High functional divergence indicates a high degree of niche differentiation, and thus low resource competition. Thus communities with high functional divergence may have increased ecosystem function as a result of more efficient resource use. [[Mason2005_Functionalrichness]] 

Whether populous species have traits close to the average trait value. High values signify that the most populous species have trait extreme trait values. It is unaffected by FD richness. I do not understand the use of this metric.
