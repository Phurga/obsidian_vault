[[Biodiversity]] is not only characterized by [[ecological composition|compositional]] aspects but but also by **structural** aspects, i.e., that is the diversity of [[symbiosis]]s.

[[Hedde, MickaÃ«l]] and [[Bernard, Laetitia]] for instance insists on the **interactional value of biodiversity**. An indicator for biodiversity beyond species can be species interactions, currently estimated via [[cooccurence]].

>[!warning] Cooccurence does not mean there is an interaction, but merely they coexist in a macrohabitat (macro at their scale).

[[Hedde2025_Diversityroles]] will publish on the evolution of species coocurrence depending on [[land management]].
