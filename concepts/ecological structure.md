One aspect of a biodiverse system is its **ecological structure**. It relates to interactions amongst the system elements (for an ecosystem, the [[ecological composition|biocenosis]]).

Species interact as the ecosystem functions.

There is a range of possible species interactions [[Ings2009_ReviewEcological]]:
- short term interactions, led by *predatory relationships* studied via the concept of the [[food web]],
- other short term interactions such as *pollination* and *seed dispersal*,
- long term interactions, aka [[symbiosis]].
	- not also habitat modification (made by species classified as [[ecosystem engineer]]s)

Species interactions are studied through [[ecological networks]]. But most approaches only consider only species *cooccurence* and not actual relationships.

[[Hedde, MickaÃ«l]] and [[Bernard, Laetitia]] for instance insists on the **interactional value of biodiversity**.

>[!warning] Cooccurence does not mean there is an interaction, but merely they coexist in a macrohabitat (macro at their scale).
