**Ribonucleic acid (RNA)** is an essential molecule in biological functions.

RNA can be messenger (mRNA). It carries genetic information and is used by a ribosome to synthetize a given [[protein]].
RNA can also be used for other purpose than carrying genetic information, this is non-coding RNA. For instance, transfer RNA (tRNA) is used to physically carry [[amino-acid]]s to the ribosome where a mRNA molecule will be used to convert these amino-acids into a protein.

It is one of the major source of [[phosphorus]] in [[organism|organisms]].

The molecular difference between [[DNA]] and RNA is the sugar backbone (ribose for RNA, deoxyribose for DNA).
