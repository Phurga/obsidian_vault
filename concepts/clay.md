**Clay** is a small [[mineral]] compound (<2micrometer). Because of its size and composition, it has a high [[electronic reactivity]] ([[cationic activity]]). This activity leads to the formation of [[soil aggregate|soil organo-mineral aggregate]].

Clay particles are not eroded from the bedrock (as sands are), but a precipitated cristal from the soil liquid phase containing solubilised minerals. It is said because the erosion rate is proportional to the surface area to particle volume ratio, which increases exponentially with reducing sizes. If clay were in the process of erosion, they would disappear quickly.

Clay can bind all around [[soil organic matter|organic matter]] particulates leading to its [[soil organic matter availability|stabilisation]].
