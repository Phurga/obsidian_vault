FIRST

CURRENTLY
regional species richness (gamma diversity) loss and global extinction risk, calculated based on the species area relationship, is the current consensus for estimating impacts on ecosystem quality ([[UNEP2016_GlobalGuidance]], [[Woods2018_Ecosystemquality]])
BECAUSE
[[LCIA method development is limited by data availability]] AND species richness is easy to calculate 
BUT
AND 


IDEAS:
use functions or genes as a basis for soil biodiversity (not species composition but what species provide: genetic pool and ecosystem functions)

## current tracks
[[chosing relevant indicators]]
[[monitoring the advancement of conservation policies is the main goal of biodiversity LCIA]]
[[protecting above-ground biodiversity is not always sufficient to protect soil biodiversity]]
[[alpha diversity in relative species loss is not relevant]]
