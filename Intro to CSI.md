## base question
What is the contribution of our material consumption to the ecologic crisis ? With the environmentalist movement developping in the end 20th century, scholars are researching methods to answer such questions. 
## global products and life cycle analysis
The end of the 20th century is also the rapid globalisation of the economy. Most modern products consumed in local markets are in fact linked to a global industrial and commercial network. No European market without African ore, Chinese factories, American oil. Assessing the environmental impacts of such a product first requires the definition of the complete economic system enabling its existence. It also requires being able to define environmental impacts of any activity involved, accounting for regional contexts. 

The life cycle assessment (LCA) framework [@ISO2006_ISO14040] aims at adressing this challenge, by considering the environmental impacts of a product through a "product system" perspective. This product system links all activities involved with the use of the product, both upstream (production, logistics etc) and downstream (end of life treatments). Any activity can be brought down to a list of exchanges with the environment (elementary flows), marking a potential human-induced environmental impact. The frameworks considers a range of environmental issues (such as climate change, eutrophication, water scarcity) which are quantified using coefficients (characterization factors) applied to each elementary flow. The results for environmental issue (midpoints results) can be used to capture impacts on areas of protections (endpoint results), the most consensual being human health and ecosystem quality [@UNEP2016_GlobalGuidance; @Verones2017_LCIAframework].

The ecosytem quality area of protection aims at measuring the degradation of nature
## From nature to species richness
### nature conservation, environmental ethics
The environmentalist movement often relies on a biocentric paradigm, human "live with nature" and acknowledge the right for non-human beings to exist. This induces a responsibility for human to limit their impacts on nature as they interact with their environment (stewardship)  [@IPBES2022_SummaryPolicymakers].
More recently, nature protection is also considered for anthropocentric motives: ecosystem are being degraded at scales challenging their ability to function and deliver services of high value for human societies [@IPBES2019_Globalassessment]. Numerous local degradations of high amplitude could also induce global, irreversible changes, as we exceed a "safe operating space" [@Richardson2023_Earthsix].
### nature, ecosystems, biodiversity
Humans are now able to exert massive pressures on natural environments, degrading ecosystems structure, accelerating the loss of species beyond sustainable rates, threathening ecosystem function at local and global scale.
An ecosystem is the base unit of nature, a community of organisms interacting with its environment. The biosphere hosts a great diversity of environmental conditions (biotopes), and evolutionary processes have favoured the development of millions of species, inhabiting these biotopes.
