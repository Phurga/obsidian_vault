Soil has many values for us. It can be considere as a space, i.e. as land to use. As a resource potential, for food production or other use requiring soil properties. As natural heritage, with conservation value. Or can even be linked to identity with the concept of terroir [@INRAE2025_PreserverQualite]. Soils are degrading at alarming rates globally [@FAOandITPS2015_Statusworlds] and 60% of European soils are considered degraded [@Panagos2024_HowEU]. Degraded soils show degraded soil functionning. Soil functions include soil structure maintenance, water regulation, contaminant regulation, nutrient cycling, carbon storage and biodiversity support [@INRAE2025_PreserverQualite]. Being at the origin of terrestrial ecosystem fertility, healthy soils are critical to ecosystem functioning and its associated prosivision of ecosystem services and is increasingly captured in environmental policies [@EuropeanCommission2025_ProposalDirective].

Soil function heavily rely on soil organisms [@PublicationsOfficeoftheEuropeanUnion2016_GlobalSoil;@FAO2020_Stateknowledge]. Soil shows outstanding biodiversity, hosting more than half of species on Earth [@Anthony2023_EnumeratingSoil].
