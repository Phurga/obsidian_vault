Soil is full of a hyperdiverse life, hosting more than half of species on Earth [@Anthony2023_EnumeratingSoil]. Relative to Earth scale, soil is a thin layer critical to all terrestrial ecosystem function and delivering many services to human societies such as water filtration or simply a stable ground to build on.

@INRAE2025_PreserverQualite describes different perceptions of soils:
- soil as a surface (land or ground)
- soil as a resource potential, such as for productive use (soil)
- soil as heritage (earth)
- soil as identity (terroir)
