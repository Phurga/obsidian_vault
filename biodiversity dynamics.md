The diversity of biological systems is **dynamic** : its composition, structure and function will change as it is [[main pressures on biodiversity|pressured]] (e.g. human activity, climate change). Biodiverse systems tend to be more resilient, keeping similar function under stress, finding new equilibriums through reorganisation (changes in composition and structure), returning to their original function after stress relief.
Rapid, powerful changes can break the system's ability to find an equilibrium, leading to reduced functionality, or collapse (e.g. desertification). 

An ecosystem's biocenose is continuously changing, even without external (human) interventions. Biodiversity conservation does not consist in halting species extinction, but avoiding causing it.
