[{"id":"Abrego2024_AirborneDNA","abstract":"Fungi are among the most diverse and ecologically important kingdoms in life. However, the distributional ranges of fungi remain largely unknown as do the ecological mechanisms that shape their distributions1,2. To provide an integrated view of the spatial and seasonal dynamics of fungi, we implemented a globally distributed standardized aerial sampling of fungal spores3. The vast majority of operational taxonomic units were detected within only one climatic zone, and the spatiotemporal patterns of species richness and community composition were mostly explained by annual mean air temperature. Tropical regions hosted the highest fungal diversity except for lichenized, ericoid mycorrhizal and ectomycorrhizal fungi, which reached their peak diversity in temperate regions. The sensitivity in climatic responses was associated with phylogenetic relatedness, suggesting that large-scale distributions of some fungal groups are partially constrained by their ancestral niche. There was a strong phylogenetic signal in seasonal sensitivity, suggesting that some groups of fungi have retained their ancestral trait of sporulating for only a short period. Overall, our results show that the hyperdiverse kingdom of fungi follows globally highly predictable spatial and temporal dynamics, with seasonality in both species richness and community composition increasing with latitude. Our study reports patterns resembling those described for other major groups of organisms, thus making a major contribution to the long-standing debate on whether organisms with a microbial lifestyle follow the global biodiversity paradigms known for macroorganisms4,5.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",6,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Abrego","given":"Nerea"},{"family":"Furneaux","given":"Brendan"},{"family":"Hardwick","given":"Bess"},{"family":"Somervuo","given":"Panu"},{"family":"Palorinne","given":"Isabella"},{"family":"Aguilar-Trigueros","given":"Carlos A."},{"family":"Andrew","given":"Nigel R."},{"family":"Babiy","given":"Ulyana V."},{"family":"Bao","given":"Tan"},{"family":"Bazzano","given":"Gisela"},{"family":"Bondarchuk","given":"Svetlana N."},{"family":"Bonebrake","given":"Timothy C."},{"family":"Brennan","given":"Georgina L."},{"family":"Bret-Harte","given":"Syndonia"},{"family":"Bässler","given":"Claus"},{"family":"Cagnolo","given":"Luciano"},{"family":"Cameron","given":"Erin K."},{"family":"Chapurlat","given":"Elodie"},{"family":"Creer","given":"Simon"},{"family":"D’Acqui","given":"Luigi P."},{"family":"Vere","given":"Natasha","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Desprez-Loustau","given":"Marie-Laure"},{"family":"Dongmo","given":"Michel A.

Here, we present a deep learning approach that directly estimates species richness, skipping the step of estimating individual species ranges. We train a neural network model based on species lists from inventory plots, which provide ground truth data for supervised machine learning. The model learns to predict species richness based on spatially associated variables, including climatic and geographic predictors, as well as counts of available species records from online databases. We assess the empirical utility of our approach by producing independently verifiable maps of alpha, beta, and gamma plant diversity at high spatial resolutions for Australia, a continent with highly heterogeneous diversity patterns.

Previous efforts to enumerate soil biodiversity consider only certain types of organisms (e.g., animals) or report values for diverse groups without partitioning species that live in soil versus other habitats. Here, we reviewed the biodiversity literature to show that soil is likely home to 59 ± 15% of the species on Earth. We therefore estimate an approximately two times greater soil biodiversity than previous estimates, and we include representatives from the simplest (microbial) to most complex (mammals) organisms. Enchytraeidae have the greatest percentage of species in soil (98.6%), followed by fungi (90%), Plantae (85.5%), and Isoptera (84.2%). Our results demonstrate that soil is the most biodiverse singular habitat. By using this estimate of soil biodiversity, we can more accurately and quantitatively advocate for soil organismal conservation and restoration as a central goal of the Anthropocene.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",3,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Anthony","given":"Mark A."},{"family":"Bender","given":"S.

DNA barcoding utilizes one or more standardized short DNA regions for taxon identification. With the emergence of new sequencing techniques, such as Next-generation sequencing (NGS), ONT MinION nanopore sequencing, and Pac Bio sequencing, DNA barcoding has become more accurate, fast, and reliable. Rapid species identification by DNA barcodes has been used in a variety of fields, including forensic science, control of the food supply chain, and disease understanding. The Consortium for Barcode of Life (CBOL) presents various working groups to identify the universal barcode gene, such as COI in metazoans; rbcL, matK, and ITS in plants; ITS in fungi; 16S rRNA gene in bacteria and archaea, and creating a reference DNA barcode library. In this article, an attempt has been made to analyze the various proposed DNA barcode for different organisms, strengths & limitations, recent advancements in DNA barcoding, and methods to speed up the DNA barcode reference library construction. This study concludes that constructing a reference library with high species coverage would be a major step toward identifying species by DNA barcodes.

Here we show, by leveraging metagenomics and metabarcoding of global topsoil samples (189 sites, 7,560 subsamples), that bacterial, but not fungal, genetic diversity is highest in temperate habitats and that microbial gene composition varies more strongly with environmental variables than with geographic distance. We demonstrate that fungi and bacteria show global niche differentiation that is associated with contrasting diversity responses to precipitation and soil pH. Furthermore, we provide evidence for strong bacterial–fungal antagonism, inferred from antibiotic-resistance genes, in topsoil and ocean habitats, indicating the substantial role of biotic interactions in shaping microbial communities. Our results suggest that both competition and environmental filtering affect the abundance, composition and encoded gene functions of bacterial and fungal communities, indicating that the relative contributions of these microorganisms to global nutrient cycling varies spatially.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",5,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Bahram","given":"Mohammad"},{"family":"Hildebrand","given":"Falk"},{"family":"Forslund","given":"Sofia K."},{"family":"Anderson","given":"Jennifer L."},{"family":"Soudzilovskaia","given":"Nadejda A."},{"family":"Bodegom","given":"Peter M.","non-dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Bengtsson-Palme","given":"Johan"},{"family":"Anslan","given":"Sten"},{"family":"Coelho","given":"Luis Pedro"},{"family":"Harend","given":"Helery"},{"family":"Huerta-Cepas","given":"Jaime"},{"family":"Medema","given":"Marnix H."},{"family":"Maltz","given":"Mia R."},{"family":"Mundra","given":"Sunil"},{"family":"Olsson","given":"Pål Axel"},{"family":"Pent","given":"Mari"},{"family":"Põlme","given":"Sergei"},{"family":"Sunagawa","given":"Shinichi"},{"family":"Ryberg","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Tedersoo","given":"Leho"},{"family":"Bork","given":"Peer"}],"citation-key":"Bahram2018_Structurefunction","container-title":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/s41586-018-0386-6","ISSN":"1476-4687","issue":"7717","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",8]]},"language":"en","license":"2018 Springer Nature Limited","page":"233-237","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Structure and function of the global topsoil microbiome","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0386-6","volume":"560"},{"id":"Baize2009_ReferentielPedologique","author":[{"family":"Baize","given":"Denis"},{"family":"Girard","given":"Michel C."}],"citation-key":"Baize2009_ReferentielPedologique","event-place":"Versailles","ISBN":"978-2-7592-0186-0","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009"]]},"language":"fr","note":"OCLC: 846958670","publisher":"Éditions Quæ","publisher-place":"Versailles","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"Référentiel pédologique 2008","type":"book"},{"id":"Balesdent2018_Atmospheresoil","abstract":"The exchange of carbon between soil organic carbon (SOC) and the atmosphere affects the climate1,2 and—because of the importance of organic matter to soil fertility—agricultural productivity3. The dynamics of topsoil carbon has been relatively well quantified4, but half of the soil carbon is located in deeper soil layers (below 30 centimetres)5–7, and many questions remain regarding the exchange of this deep carbon with the atmosphere8. This knowledge gap restricts soil carbon management policies and limits global carbon models1,9,10. Here we quantify the recent incorporation of atmosphere-derived carbon atoms into whole-soil profiles, through a meta-analysis of changes in stable carbon isotope signatures at 112 grassland, forest and cropland sites, across different climatic zones, from 1965 to 2015. We find, in agreement with previous work5,6, that soil at a depth of 30–100 centimetres beneath the surface (the subsoil) contains on average 47 per cent of the topmost metre’s SOC stocks. However, we show that this subsoil accounts for just 19 per cent of the SOC that has been recently incorporated (within the past 50 years) into the topmost metre. Globally, the median depth of recent carbon incorporation into mineral soil is 10 centimetres. Variations in the relative allocation of carbon to deep soil layers are better explained by the aridity index than by mean annual temperature. Land use for crops reduces the incorporation of carbon into the soil surface layer, but not into deeper layers. Our results suggest that SOC dynamics and its responses to climatic control or land use are strongly dependent on soil depth. We propose that using multilayer soil modules in global carbon models, tested with our data, could help to improve our understanding of soil–atmosphere carbon exchange.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",4,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Balesdent","given":"Jérôme"},{"family":"Basile-Doelsch","given":"Isabelle"},{"family":"Chadoeuf","given":"Joël"},{"family":"Cornu","given":"Sophie"},{"family":"Derrien","given":"Delphine"},{"family":"Fekiacova","given":"Zuzana"},{"family":"Hatté","given":"Christine"}],"citation-key":"Balesdent2018_Atmospheresoil","container-title":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/s41586-018-0328-3","ISSN":"1476-4687","issue":"7715","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",7]]},"language":"en","license":"2018 Macmillan Publishers Ltd., part of Springer Nature","page":"599-602","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Atmosphere–soil carbon transfer as a function of soil depth","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0328-3","volume":"559"},{"id":"Banerjee2019_GoodEconomics","abstract":"\"Figuring out how to deal with today's critical economic problems is perhaps the great challenge of our time.

Advances in knowledge on the mechanistic processes of soil functions, their connection throughout the critical zone, and their quantitative representation in mathematical and computational models define research frontiers that address the major global challenges of critical zone resource provisioning for human benefit. ▪ Connecting the mechanisms of soil functions with critical zone processes defines integrating science to tackle challenges of climate change and food and water supply. ▪ Soil functions, which develop through formation of soil aggregates as fundamental eco-logical units, are manifest at the earliest stages of critical zone evolution. ▪ Global degradation of soil functions during the Anthropocene is reversible through positive human intervention in soil as a central control point in Earth&apos;s critical zone. ▪ Measurement and mathematical translation of soil functions and critical zone processes offer new computational approaches for basic and applied geosciences research.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",3,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Banwart","given":"Steven A."},{"family":"Nikolaidis","given":"Nikolaos P."},{"family":"Zhu","given":"Yong-Guan"},{"family":"Peacock","given":"Caroline L."},{"family":"Sparks","given":"Donald L."}],"citation-key":"Banwart2019_SoilFunctions","container-title":"Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences","DOI":"10.1146/annurev-earth-063016-020544","ISSN":"0084-6597, 1545-4495","issue":"Volume 47, 2019","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",5,30]]},"language":"en","number":"Volume 47, 2019","page":"333-359","publisher":"Annual Reviews","source":"www.annualreviews.org","title":"Soil Functions: Connecting Earth's Critical Zone","title-short":"Soil Functions","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-earth-063016-020544","volume":"47"},{"id":"Bar-On2018_BiomassDistribution","abstract":"The composition of the biosphere is a fundamental question in biology, yet a global quantitative account of the biomass of each taxon is still lacking. We assemble a census of the biomass of all kingdoms of life. This analysis provides a holistic view of the composition of the biosphere and allows us to observe broad patterns over taxonomic categories, geographic locations, and trophic modes., A census of the biomass on Earth is key for understanding the structure and dynamics of the biosphere. However, a global, quantitative view of how the biomass of different taxa compare with one another is still lacking. Here, we assemble the overall biomass composition of the biosphere, establishing a census of the ≈550 gigatons of carbon (Gt C) of biomass distributed among all of the kingdoms of life. We find that the kingdoms of life concentrate at different locations on the planet; plants (≈450 Gt C, the dominant kingdom) are primarily terrestrial, whereas animals (≈2 Gt C) are mainly marine, and bacteria (≈70 Gt C) and archaea (≈7 Gt C) are predominantly located in deep subsurface environments. We show that terrestrial biomass is about two orders of magnitude higher than marine biomass and estimate a total of ≈6 Gt C of marine biota, doubling the previous estimated quantity. Our analysis reveals that the global marine biomass pyramid contains more consumers than producers, thus increasing the scope of previous observations on inverse food pyramids. Finally, we highlight that the mass of humans is an order of magnitude higher than that of all wild mammals combined and report the historical impact of humanity on the global biomass of prominent taxa, including mammals, fish, and plants.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",3,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Bar-On","given":"Yinon M."},{"family":"Phillips","given":"Rob"},{"family":"Milo","given":"Ron"}],"citation-key":"Bar-On2018_BiomassDistribution","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","container-title-short":"PNAS","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1711842115","ISSN":"0027-8424","issue":"25","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",6,19]]},"number":"25","page":"6506-6511","PMCID":"PMC6016768","PMID":"29784790","source":"PubMed Central","title":"The biomass distribution on Earth","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1711842115","volume":"115"},{"id":"Basile-Doelsch2020_Reviewssyntheses","abstract":"Scientific research in the 21st century has considerably improved our knowledge of soil organic matter and its dynamics, particularly under the pressure of the global disruption of the carbon cycle.

The most recent advances in soil organic matter knowledge are: – Most organic matter is composed of small molecules, derived from living organisms, without transformation via additional abiotic organic polymerization. – Microbial compounds are predominant in the long term. – Primary belowground production contributes more to organic matter than aboveground inputs. – Contribution of less biodegradable compounds to soil organic matter is low in the long term. – Two major factors determine the soil organic carbon production yield from the initial substrates: the yield of carbon used by microorganisms and the association with minerals, particularly poorly crystallized minerals, which stabilize microbial compounds. – Interactions between plants and microorganisms and between microbial communities affect or even regulate carbon residence times, and therefore carbon stocks. Farming practices therefore affect soil C stocks not only through carbon inputs but also via their effect on microbial and organomineral interactions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",4,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Basile-Doelsch","given":"Isabelle"},{"family":"Balesdent","given":"Jérôme"},{"family":"Pellerin","given":"Sylvain"}],"citation-key":"Basile-Doelsch2020_Reviewssyntheses","container-title":"Biogeosciences","DOI":"10.5194/bg-17-5223-2020","issue":"21","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"page":"5223–5242","publisher":"European Geosciences Union","source":"HAL Archives Ouvertes","title":"Reviews and syntheses: The mechanisms underlying carbon storage in soil","title-short":"Reviews and syntheses","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://hal.science/hal-02987610","volume":"17"},{"id":"Beck2010_LANCALand","author":[{"family":"Beck","given":"Tabea"},{"family":"Bos","given":"Ulrike"},{"family":"Wittstock","given":"Bastian"},{"family":"Baitz","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Fischer","given":"Matthias"},{"family":"Sedlbauer","given":"Klaus"}],"citation-key":"Beck2010_LANCALand","event-place":"Stuttgart","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010"]]},"language":"en","note":"ISBN 978-3-8396-0170-9","publisher":"Fraunhofer Verlag","publisher-place":"Stuttgart","source":"K10plus ISBN","title":"LANCA: Land use indicator value calculation in life cycle assessment","title-short":"LANCA","type":"report"},{"id":"Belaud2024_situsoil","abstract":"The complexity of the opaque soil matrix is a major obstacle to studying the organisms that inhabit it. Fast technological progress now offers new possibilities for the monitoring of soil biodiversity and root growth, such as in situ soil imaging. This study presents the potential of soil imaging devices to investigate the temporal dynamics and spatial distribution of soil biological activity and their interactions. The soil imaging devices were buried in a truffle field located in the south of France and set up to capture images automatically every 6 h at 1200 dpi. For the first time, root growth, mycorrhizal colonization and invertebrate occurrences – for 16 taxa – were studied simultaneously on the images captured over 3 months (between May and July 2019). The peak in root growth occurred at the end of May and beginning of June, followed by a peak in ectomycorrhizal colonization in mid-June. For invertebrates, specific dynamics of activity were observed for each taxon, reflecting contrasting phenologies. The constructed network of co-occurrences between invertebrates shows a change in its structure over the period, with a reduction of connectance. At a fine scale, oak fine roots revealed temporally variable growth rates with higher values at night. This window on the opaque soil matrix addresses many methodological challenges by allowing the monitoring of soil biological activity in an integrative, dynamic and non-destructive way.

We tested for response patterns in key properties of the soil food webs in sixteen fields ranging from arable crops to grazed permanent grasslands as part of a long-term management experiment. We found that agricultural intensification drives reductions in trophic group diversity, although taxa richness remained unchanged. Intensification generally reduced the complexity and connectance of soil interaction networks and induced consistent changes in energy pathways, but the magnitude of management-induced changes depended on the variable considered. Average path length (an indicator of food web redundancy and resilience) did not respond to our management intensity gradient. Moreover, turnover of network structure showed little response to increasing management intensity.

When evaluation involves biodiversity indicators, as richness or diversity in certain taxa or their roles in ecosystems, the participation of specialists is required to identify, classify and interpret diversity at the level of species, communities and ecosystems. Due to costs and time demand, this can be an important obstacle when a widespread use of these assessments is needed to contribute to policy making and evaluation, field management decision-making or implementation of a specific technology. We developed a new index that combines different environmental characteristics which can be evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively with a basic training, can be implemented quickly and each index component is directly associated with key aspects for the assessment of ecosystem capacity to sustain wildlife and ecosystem services. The Ecosystem Integrity Index (EII) evaluates the status of a specific ecosystem under agricultural use, referred to an optimal condition that must be established for the ecoregion. Its application involves a qualitative and quantitative visual evaluation considering four components: vegetation structure, plant species, soil and riparian areas. Each component is valued on a 0–5 scale, where 5 is the best possible condition. EII is a simple and robust tool for evaluating and monitoring integrity of agroecosystems and the primary validation demonstrates good correlation with other environmental variables such as wildlife diversity and soil organic carbon.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",4,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Blumetto","given":"Oscar"},{"family":"Castagna","given":"Andrés"},{"family":"Cardozo","given":"Gerónimo"},{"family":"García","given":"Felipe"},{"family":"Tiscornia","given":"Guadalupe"},{"family":"Ruggia","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Scarlato","given":"Santiago"},{"family":"Albicette","given":"María Marta"},{"family":"Aguerre","given":"Verónica"},{"family":"Albin","given":"Alfredo"}],"citation-key":"Blumetto2019_EcosystemIntegrity","container-title":"Ecological Indicators","container-title-short":"Ecological Indicators","DOI":"10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.01.077","ISSN":"1470-160X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",6,1]]},"page":"725-733","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Ecosystem Integrity Index, an innovative environmental evaluation tool for agricultural production systems","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1470160X19300962","volume":"101"},{"id":"Bluthgen2012_QuantitativeIndex","abstract":"Land use is increasingly recognized as a major driver of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in many current research projects. In grasslands, land use is often classified by categorical descriptors such as pastures versus meadows or fertilized versus unfertilized sites. However, to account for the quantitative variation of multiple land-use types in heterogeneous landscapes, a quantitative, continuous index of land-use intensity (LUI) is desirable. Here we define such a compound, additive LUI index for managed grasslands including meadows and pastures. The LUI index summarizes the standardized intensity of three components of land use, namely fertilization, mowing, and livestock grazing at each site. We examined the performance of the LUI index to predict selected response variables on up to 150 grassland sites in the Biodiversity Exploratories in three regions in Germany (Alb, Hainich, Schorfheide). We tested the average Ellenberg nitrogen indicator values of the plant community, nitrogen and phosphorus concentration in the aboveground plant biomass, plant-available phosphorus concentration in the top soil, and soil C/N ratio, and the first principle component of these five response variables. The LUI index significantly predicted the principal component of all five response variables, as well as some of the individual responses. Moreover, vascular plant diversity decreased significantly with LUI in two regions (Alb and Hainich). Inter-annual changes in management practice were pronounced from 2006 to 2008, particularly due to variation in grazing intensity. This rendered the selection of the appropriate reference year(s) an important decision for analyses of land-use effects, whereas details in the standardization of the index were of minor importance. We also tested several alternative calculations of a LUI index, but all are strongly linearly correlated to the proposed index. The proposed LUI index reduces the complexity of agricultural practices to a single dimension and may serve as a baseline to test how different groups of organisms and processes respond to land use. In combination with more detailed analyses, this index may help to unravel whether and how land-use intensities, associated disturbance levels or other local or regional influences drive ecological processes.\nZusammenfassung\nMenschliche Landnutzung als wichtiger Treiber für die Biodiversität und Funktionen von Ökosystemen wird zunehmend in Forschungsprojekte einbezogen. Im Grünland wird die Landnutzung dazu meist durch kategoriale Variablen beschrieben wie etwa Weiden vs. Wiesen oder gedüngte vs. ungedüngte Flächen. Um jedoch die quantitative Variation in der Intensität der Landnutzung besser beschreiben zu können sind kontinuierliche Maße der Landnutzung wünschenswert. Wir führen einen quantitativen Index zur Beschreibung der Landnutzungsintensität (LUI; land-use intensity) in bewirtschaftetem Grünland ein. Der LUI Index standardisiert und addiert drei wesentliche Komponenten der Grünlandnutzung, die Beweidung, die Mahd und die Düngung. Die Effizienz des LUI Index in Bezug auf die Vorhersagefähigkeit einer Reihe landnutzungsabhängiger Variablen wurde im Rahmen des Projekts Biodiversitätsexploratorien am Beispiel von 150 Grünlandflächen in drei Regionen Deutschlands (Alb, Hainich, Schorfheide) geprüft. Die Prüfvariablen umfassten die Stickstoffzahl nach Ellenberg, die Stickstoff- und Phosphorkonzentrationen in der Biomasse, die Konzentrationen von pflanzenverfügbarem Phosphor im Oberboden, das Boden-C/N-Verhältnis sowie die erste Hauptkomponente einer Ordination dieser Variablen. Während der LUI Index Änderungen in der ersten Hauptkomponente der Antwortvariablen sowie einiger Einzelvariablen signifikant vorhersagte, waren Regressionen mit einzelnen LUI Komponenten problematisch, da diese Komponenten wie die Düngungsintensität oder Mahdfrequenz miteinander korreliert und somit konfundiert sind. Das Management der Grünlandflächen variierte im Zeitraum 2006 bis 2008 von Jahr zu Jahr, insbesondere aufgrund von Änderungen in der Beweidungsintensität. Das Referenzjahr für die Berechnungen der LUI war daher sehr wichtig, während verschiedene Standardisierungsmethoden keinen großen Einfluss auf den Index hatten. Einige alternative Berechnungsmethoden der Landnutzungsintensität korrelierten stark mit der vorschlagenen Form des Index. Der LUI Index reduziert die verschiedenen, miteinander korrelierten Dimensionen der menschlichen Landnutzung im Grünland zu einer kontinuierlichen Variable und kann dazu dienen, die Abhängigkeit verschiedener Organismengruppen und Prozesse von der menschlichen Landnutzung zu prüfen. In Verbindung mit detaillierten Analysen kann die Verwendung dieses Index helfen, die relative Bedeutung der menschlichen Landnutzung im Vergleich zu anderen lokalen oder regionalen Faktoren zu erkennen.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",6,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Blüthgen","given":"Nico"},{"family":"Dormann","given":"Carsten F."},{"family":"Prati","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Klaus","given":"Valentin H."},{"family":"Kleinebecker","given":"Till"},{"family":"Hölzel","given":"Norbert"},{"family":"Alt","given":"Fabian"},{"family":"Boch","given":"Steffen"},{"family":"Gockel","given":"Sonja"},{"family":"Hemp","given":"Andreas"},{"family":"Müller","given":"Jörg"},{"family":"Nieschulze","given":"Jens"},{"family":"Renner","given":"Swen C."},{"family":"Schöning","given":"Ingo"},{"family":"Schumacher","given":"Uta"},{"family":"Socher","given":"Stephanie A."},{"family":"Wells","given":"Konstans"},{"family":"Birkhofer","given":"Klaus"},{"family":"Buscot","given":"François"},{"family":"Oelmann","given":"Yvonne"},{"family":"Rothenwöhrer","given":"Christoph"},{"family":"Scherber","given":"Christoph"},{"family":"Tscharntke","given":"Teja"},{"family":"Weiner","given":"Christiane N."},{"family":"Fischer","given":"Markus"},{"family":"Kalko","given":"Elisabeth K.

These are the most common symbioses in the world; they involve about 6000 species of fungi distributed through all the fungal phyla and about 240,000 species of plants, including forest and crop plants. Thanks to mycorrhizal symbiosis and nutrient exchanges, regulated by complex molecular signals, the plant improves its vegetative growth, while the fungus accomplishes its life cycle. Molecular and cellular analyses demonstrate that during colonization the cellular organization of the two eukaryotes is completely remodeled. For example, in cortical cells, structural modifications involve both the host and the microbiont. Recent studies revealed that in arbuscular mycorrhizas (AM), system complexity is increased by the presence of a third symbiont: a bacterium living inside the fungus. The presence of this resident genome makes the investigation of the molecular dialogues among the symbiotic partners even more complex. Molecular analysis showed that the bacterium has genes involved in the acquisition of mineral nutrients. The experimental data support the current view that mycorrhizal symbioses are often tripartite associations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",3,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Bonfante","given":"P."}],"citation-key":"Bonfante2003_PlantsMycorrhizal","container-title":"The Biological Bulletin","DOI":"10.2307/1543562","ISSN":"0006-3185","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2003",4]]},"number":"2","page":"215-220","publisher":"The University of Chicago Press","source":"journals.uchicago.edu (Atypon)","title":"Plants, Mycorrhizal Fungi and Endobacteria: a Dialog Among Cells and                     Genomes","title-short":"Plants, Mycorrhizal Fungi and Endobacteria","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.2307/1543562","volume":"204"},{"id":"Bonfanti2025_Linkingeffect","abstract":"Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",5,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Bonfanti","given":"Jonathan"},{"family":"Potapov","given":"Anton M."},{"family":"Angst","given":"Gerrit"},{"family":"Ganault","given":"Pierre"},{"family":"Briones","given":"Maria J.

The data was generated in an automated approach consisting of data scraping and filtering, variable selection, model calibration and model selection. Generated Maxent predictions were validated by comparing a subset to available expert-drawn range maps from IUCN (n = 4,257), as well as by qualitatively inspecting predictions for randomly selected species. We expect this data to serve as a substitute whenever expert-drawn species range maps are not available for conducting large-scale analyses on biodiversity patterns and associated anthropogenic impacts.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Borgelt","given":"Jan"},{"family":"Sicacha-Parada","given":"Jorge"},{"family":"Skarpaas","given":"Olav"},{"family":"Verones","given":"Francesca"}],"citation-key":"Borgelt2022_Nativerange","container-title":"Scientific Data","container-title-short":"Sci Data","DOI":"10.1038/s41597-022-01233-5","ISSN":"2052-4463","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,29]]},"language":"en","license":"2022 The Author(s)","number":"1","page":"117","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Native range estimates for red-listed vascular plants","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01233-5","volume":"9"},{"id":"Borgelt2024_WhatImpact","abstract":"Alien species form one of the main threats to global biodiversity. Although Life Cycle Assessment attempts to holistically assess environmental impacts of products and services across value chains, ecological impacts of the introduction of alien species are so far not assessed in Life Cycle Impact Assessment. Here, we developed country-to-country-specific characterization factors, expressed as the time-integrated potentially disappeared fraction (PDF; regional and global) of native terrestrial species due to alien species introductions per unit of goods transported [kg] between two countries. The characterization factors were generated by analyzing global data on first records of alien species, native species distributions, and their threat status, as well as bilateral trade partnerships from 1870–2019. The resulting characterization factors vary over several orders of magnitude, indicating that impact greatly varies per transportation route and trading partner. We showcase the applicability and relevance of the characterization factors for transporting 1 metric ton of freight to France from China, South Africa, and Madagascar. The results suggest that the introduction of alien species can be more damaging for terrestrial biodiversity as climate change impacts during the international transport of commodities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",4,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Borgelt","given":"Jan"},{"family":"Dorber","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Géron","given":"Charly"},{"family":"Kuipers","given":"Koen J.

Despite the recent methodological developments in this area, the impacts of land occupation and transformation on its long-term ability to produce biomass (referred to here as biotic production potential - BPP) - an important endpoint for the Area of Protection Natural Resources - have been largely excluded from LCAs partly due to the lack of life cycle impact assessment methods. Methods: An overview of existing methods/indicators associated with biomass, carbon balance, soil erosion, salinisation, energy, soil biota and soil organic matter (SOM) were evaluated. The latter indicator was considered the most appropriate, and characterisation factors for 8 land use types at the climate region level were developed. Results: Some indicators address land-use impacts satisfactorily for land uses that include biotic production of some kind (agriculture or silviculture). However, some fail to address potentially important land use impacts from other life cycle stages, such as those arising from transport. It is shown that the change in SOC can be used as an indicator for BPP, which combines and relates to a range of soil properties responsible for fertility into a stand-alone indicator. Conclusions: The results suggest that the proposed approach to characterize land use impacts on Biotic Production Potential, despite its limitations, is both possible and robust. The availability of land-use specific and biogeographically-differentiated data on SOC makes BPP impact assessments operable. The characterisation factors provided allow for the assessment of land-use impacts on BPP, regardless of where they occur. This is a new development in the LCIA of land use. Existing databases on every country's terrestrial carbon stocks and land use enable the operability of this method. Furthermore, BPP impacts will be better assessed by this approach as increasingly spatially-specific data are available for all geographical regions of the world at a large-scale. The resulting information would enable better life cycle assessments of products and services, as the important issue of the land use impacts on BPP can be captured. The characterisation factors developed are applied to the case studies (Part D of this special issue), which show the practical issues related to their implementation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Brandao","given":"Miguel"},{"family":"Milà i Canals","given":"Llorenç"}],"citation-key":"Brandao2013_Globalcharacterisation","container-title":"The International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment","DOI":"10.1007/s11367-012-0381-3","ISSN":"0948-3349","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013"]]},"language":"en","source":"publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu","title":"Global characterisation factors to assess land use impacts on biotic production","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11367-012-0381-3"},{"id":"Bray1957_OrdinationUpland","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",6,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Bray","given":"John R."},{"family":"Curtis","given":"John T."}],"citation-key":"Bray1957_OrdinationUpland","container-title":"Ecological Monographs","DOI":"10.2307/1942268","ISSN":"0012-9615","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["1957"]]},"page":"326-349","publisher":"Ecological Society of America","source":"JSTOR","title":"An Ordination of the Upland Forest Communities of Southern Wisconsin","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/1942268","volume":"27"},{"id":"Breznak2000_EcologyProkaryotic","abstract":"The gut of wood- and litter-feeding termites harbors a dense and diverse community of prokaryotes that contribute to the carbon, nitrogen and energy requirements of the insects.

Microelectrode studies reveal that hindguts consist of an anoxic lumen surrounded by a microoxic periphery — a finding consistent with the occurrence of both anaerobic and O2-dependent microbial metabolism in hindguts. They also suggest that the enigmatic dominance of acetogens over methanogens as an H2 “sink” reflects a spatial separation of these H2-consuming populations, with the former being closer to sources of H2 production. Isolation of a number of the prokaryotes (including spirochetes, which have proven to be H2/CO2-acetogens) reveals that termite guts are a source of novel microbial diversity.

Humanity exacerbates extinction rates. But by what mechanisms does humanity drive the emergence of new species? We review human-mediated speciation, compare speciation and known extinctions, and discuss the challenges of using net species diversity as a conservation objective. Humans drive rapid evolution through relocation, domestication, hunting and novel ecosystem creation—and emerging technologies could eventually provide additional mechanisms. The number of species relocated, domesticated and hunted during the Holocene is of comparable magnitude to the number of observed extinctions. While instances of human-mediated speciation are known, the overall effect these mechanisms have upon speciation rates has not yet been quantified. We also explore the importance of anthropogenic influence upon divergence in microorganisms. Even if human activities resulted in no net loss of species diversity by balancing speciation and extinction rates, this would probably be deemed unacceptable. We discuss why, based upon ‘no net loss’ conservation literature—considering phylogenetic diversity and other metrics, risk aversion, taboo trade-offs and spatial heterogeneity. We conclude that evaluating speciation alongside extinction could result in more nuanced understanding of biosphere trends, clarifying what it is we actually value about biodiversity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",6,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Bull","given":"J.

Undisturbed trials served as controls, these were all combined with either no fertilisation, mineral fertilisation or a combined mineral and organic fertilisation. It took only 26 years until new topsoil had been formed. Its soil organic carbon (SOC) and total N stocks and the aggregate size distributions equalled that of the other treatments; SOC sequestration corresponded to 28 Mg SOC ha−1. The former topsoil buried below the plough layer lost 30–50 percent of its SOC during 5 decades in a non-linear manner.

The acceleration of human-driven land use change, such as agricultural intensification, is a major driver of soil C loss globally. Developing sustainable land use practices that enhance agricultural productivity whilst protecting essential ecosystem functions such as soil C storage is vital. The soil microbiome has a critical role in regulating soil biogeochemical cycling processes, including soil C cycling. Examining the impacts of land use intensity on the soil microbiome enables us to assess the potential effects on long-term soil C stocks. Using metagenomic DNA sequencing and phospholipid fatty acid analysis, we investigated differences in the activity, diversity, and function of the soil microbiome associated with five contrasting land uses across an agricultural landscape. The land uses covered a gradient of disturbance intensities and included remnant native forest, regenerating native bush, exotic plantation forest, dryland pasture, and irrigated pasture. We identified pronounced differences in the soil microbiome associated with each land use, including the diversity and abundance of microbial C and nitrogen (N) cycling genes. Notably, intensive agricultural land uses had a significantly higher diversity and abundance of microbial C-degrading genes, whilst land uses of remnant native forest had the lowest diversity and abundance of microbial C-degrading genes. Our findings suggest that intensive agricultural land use may increase the functional potential of the soil microbiome to mineralize soil C, potentially resulting in a greater loss of soil C as respired CO2 into the atmosphere. This research may be used to support the development of sustainable management practices that promote the persistence of soil C across agricultural landscapes, such as the protection of remnant native forest fragments and greater incorporation of regenerating native vegetation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",6,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Byers","given":"Alexa K."},{"family":"Condron","given":"Leo"},{"family":"Wakelin","given":"Steve A."},{"family":"Black","given":"Amanda"}],"citation-key":"Byers2024_LandUse","container-title":"Soil Biology and Biochemistry","container-title-short":"Soil Biology and Biochemistry","DOI":"10.1016/j.soilbio.2024.109508","ISSN":"0038-0717","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",9,1]]},"page":"109508","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Land use intensity is a major driver of soil microbial and carbon cycling across an agricultural landscape","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038071724001974","volume":"196"},{"id":"Bystricky2024_Combiningimpact","author":[{"family":"Bystricky","given":"Maria"},{"family":"Jeanneret","given":"Philippe"}],"citation-key":"Bystricky2024_Combiningimpact","event-place":"Zurich","event-title":"87th LCA Discussion Forum","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",9,23]]},"language":"en","publisher-place":"Zurich","title":"Combining the impact on biodiversity of agricultural management practices at local scale with land use at global scale","type":"speech","URL":"https://lca-forum.ch/fileadmin/generic_lib/Resources/Public/Downloads/DF87/5_LCA-DF_Bystricky_SALCA-BD.pdf"},{"id":"Calderon-Sanou2022_betterunderstanding","author":[{"family":"Calderón-Sanou","given":"Irene"}],"citation-key":"Calderon-Sanou2022_betterunderstanding","event-place":"Grenoble, France","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"publisher":"Université Grenoble Alpes","publisher-place":"Grenoble, France","source":"Zotero","title":"Towards a better understanding of soil multi-trophic biodiversity through the use of environmental DNA metabarcoding","type":"thesis","URL":"https://theses.hal.science/tel-03890224v1"},{"id":"Callicott1995_IntrinsicValue","author":[{"family":"Callicott","given":"J.

A large proportion of terrestrial biodiversity is harbored by soil, but soil biodiversity has been omitted from many global biodiversity assessments and conservation actions, and understanding of global patterns of soil biodiversity remains limited. In particular, the extent to which hotspots and coldspots of aboveground and soil biodiversity overlap is not clear. We examined global patterns of these overlaps by mapping indices of aboveground (mammals, birds, amphibians, vascular plants) and soil (bacteria, fungi, macrofauna) biodiversity that we created using previously published data on species richness. Areas of mismatch between aboveground and soil biodiversity covered 27% of Earth's terrestrial surface. The temperate broadleaf and mixed forests biome had the highest proportion of grid cells with high aboveground biodiversity but low soil biodiversity, whereas the boreal and tundra biomes had intermediate soil biodiversity but low aboveground biodiversity. While more data on soil biodiversity are needed, both to cover geographic gaps and to include additional taxa, our results suggest that protecting aboveground biodiversity may not sufficiently reduce threats to soil biodiversity.

Many studies have linked this process to soil nutrient mobilization. Yet, it remains unresolved how exudation is controlled and how exactly and under what circumstances plants benefit from exudation. The majority of root exudates including primary metabolites (sugars, amino acids, and organic acids) are believed to be passively lost from the root and used by rhizosphere-dwelling microbes. In this review, we synthetize recent advances in ecology and plant biology to explain and propose mechanisms by which root exudation of primary metabolites is controlled, and what role their exudation plays in plant nutrient acquisition strategies. Specifically, we propose a novel conceptual framework for root exudates. This framework is built upon two main concepts: (1) root exudation of primary metabolites is driven by diffusion, with plants and microbes both modulating concentration gradients and therefore diffusion rates to soil depending on their nutritional status; (2) exuded metabolite concentrations can be sensed at the root tip and signals are translated to modify root architecture. The flux of primary metabolites through root exudation is mostly located at the root tip, where the lack of cell differentiation favors diffusion of metabolites to the soil. We show examples of how the root tip senses concentration changes of exuded metabolites and translates that into signals to modify root growth. Plants can modify the concentration of metabolites either by controlling source/sink processes or by expressing and regulating efflux carriers, therefore challenging the idea of root exudation as a purely unregulated passive process. Through root exudate flux, plants can locally enhance concentrations of many common metabolites, which can serve as sensors and integrators of the plant nutritional status and of the nutrient availability in the surrounding environment. Plant-associated micro-organisms also constitute a strong sink for plant carbon, thereby increasing concentration gradients of metabolites and affecting root exudation. Understanding the mechanisms of and the effects that environmental stimuli have on the magnitude and type of root exudation will ultimately improve our knowledge of processes determining soil CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, ecosystem functioning, and how to improve the sustainability of agricultural production.</p>","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",3,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Canarini","given":"Alberto"},{"family":"Kaiser","given":"Christina"},{"family":"Merchant","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Richter","given":"Andreas"},{"family":"Wanek","given":"Wolfgang"}],"citation-key":"Canarini2019_RootExudation","container-title":"Frontiers in Plant Science","container-title-short":"Front.

This is troublesome since they were not designed for this purpose and thus the relevance of such a use was never tested nor proven. How earthworms influence the different soil functions is tightly linked to their bioturbating behavior and thus they are considered as physical ecosystem engineers. Here, we characterized the different facets of this behavior (burrow creation, production of casts below and above ground, and litter consumption) for 50 species or subspecies of European earthworms under standardized laboratory conditions. Using PCA and K-means methods, we defined six new functional groups of earthworms, i.e. intense tunnelers, burrowers, shallow bioturbators, deep bioturbators, litter dwellers and intermediates. Intense tunnelers and burrowers build continuous and vertically oriented burrows, the first however burrow more and consume less litter. Deep bioturbators live deeply in the soil, make very discontinuous burrows and consume no litter. They could be seen as a novel group but they can be linked to the hypo-endogeics ecological categories defined 50 years ago. Litter-dwellers and shallow bioturbators can be respectively linked to the epidegeics and endogeics ecological categories. However, the new groups only partially overlap with the traditional ecological categories. We assume that their use, based on quantitative behavioral assessments, will improve the study of the relationships between earthworm communities and the associated provision of ecosystem services by minimizing the overlooked variability within the three main ecological categories regarding their behavior.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",3,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Capowiez","given":"Yvan"},{"family":"Marchán","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Decaëns","given":"Thibaud"},{"family":"Hedde","given":"Mickael"},{"family":"Bottinelli","given":"Nicolas"}],"citation-key":"Capowiez2024_Letearthworms","container-title":"Soil Biology and Biochemistry","container-title-short":"Soil Biology and Biochemistry","DOI":"10.1016/j.soilbio.2023.109209","ISSN":"0038-0717","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,1]]},"page":"109209","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Let earthworms be functional - Definition of new functional groups based on their bioturbation behavior","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038071723002717","volume":"188"},{"id":"CBD2000_Sustaininglife","citation-key":"CBD2000_Sustaininglife","contributor":[{"literal":"CBD"}],"event-place":"Montreal","ISBN":"978-92-807-1904-8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2000"]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Convention on Biological Diversity","publisher-place":"Montreal","source":"K10plus ISBN","title":"Sustaining life on earth: how the Convention on biological diversity promotes nature and human well-being","title-short":"Sustaining life on earth","type":"report"},{"id":"CBD2011_ConventionBiological","abstract":"The Earth’s biological resources are vital to humanity’s economic and social development.\nAs a result, there is growing recognition that biological diversity is a global asset of\ntremendous value to present and future generations.

Yet, it faces significant threats from land-use changes, pollution, agricultural intensification, and climate change. Effective predictive modeling tools are urgently needed to inform conservation and management strategies. Although species distribution models (SDMs) have been successful for aboveground biodiversity, their application to soil biodiversity is limited by scarce large-scale datasets with spatial mismatches between environmental data and soil habitats. Recent advances, including environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding, now allow extensive multi-taxa assessments of soil biodiversity. Simultaneously, remote sensing technologies provide high-resolution spatial data, potentially overcoming traditional coarse-gridded environmental limitations. This study evaluates Earth Observation Foundation (EOF) models, deep learning models pretrained on massive remote sensing datasets to summarize earth observation images into embeddings, to predict multi-trophic soil biodiversity in the French Alps. We compare models using EOF-derived embeddings from orthophotos with coarse-gridded and high-quality in-situ variables. We modeled relative abundance for 51 trophic groups across seven taxa using Random Forest, Light Gradient Boosting Machine, and Artificial Neural Networks, evaluating four data configurations: coarse-gridded environmental data, high-quality in-situ data, EOF embeddings, and a hybrid embedding-tabular approach. High-quality in-situ climate and soil data consistently delivered the highest predictive accuracy, especially for microbial and fungal groups. EOF embeddings provided valuable spatial context but did not surpass in-situ data performance, showing partial redundancy. Integrating remote sensing data can enhance biodiversity modeling in areas lacking detailed in-situ measurements, underscoring their complementary role in ecological assessments.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",5,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Cerna","given":"Selene"},{"family":"Si-Moussi","given":"Sara"},{"family":"Calderón-Sanou","given":"Irene"},{"family":"Miele","given":"Vincent"},{"family":"Thuiller","given":"Wilfried"}],"citation-key":"Cerna2025_Limitspromises","DOI":"10.1101/2025.05.16.654504","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",5,21]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2025, Posted by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.

In the first experiment, we reciprocally transplanted microbial communities from five sites to test whether ecological shifts in ecotypes of the abundant bacterium, Curtobacterium, corresponded to past adaptive differentiation. In the transplanted communities, ecotypes converged toward that of the native communities growing on a common litter substrate. Moreover, these shifts were correlated with community-weighted mean trait values of the Curtobacterium ecotypes, indicating that some of the trait variation among ecotypes could be explained by local adaptation to climate conditions. In the second experiment, we transplanted an isogenic Curtobacterium strain and tracked genomic mutations associated with the sites across the same climate gradient. Using a combination of genomic and metagenomic approaches, we identified a variety of nonrandom, parallel mutations associated with transplantation, including mutations in genes related to nutrient acquisition, stress response, and exopolysaccharide production. Together, the field experiments demonstrate how both demographic shifts of previously adapted ecotypes and contemporary evolution can alter the diversity of a soil microbiome on the same timescale.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",4,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Chase","given":"Alexander B."},{"family":"Weihe","given":"Claudia"},{"family":"Martiny","given":"Jennifer B.

We show that in terms of local species richness loss, forest management types can be ranked, from best to worse, as follows: selection and retention systems, reduced impact logging, conventional selective logging, clear-cutting, agroforestry, timber plantations, fuelwood plantations. Next, we calculated the economic profitability in terms of the net present value of timber harvesting from 10 hypothetical wood-producing Forest Management Units (FMU) from around the globe. The ranking of management types is altered when the species loss per unit profit generated from the FMU is considered.

The aim of this study was to identify the global regions projected to suffer the highest PD loss due to human land use in the near future. Location Global. Methods We demonstrate a novel approach combining countryside species–area relationship, species-specific evolutionary distinctiveness (ED) scores and a newly derived strong linear relationship between the cumulative ED loss and PD loss through pruning simulations on global evolutionary trees of mammals, birds, and amphibians under random species loss, to project global land use-driven phylogenetic diversity loss in 804 terrestrial ecoregions and 175 countries. We also allocate the total projected PD loss to different land use types (agriculture, forestry, grazing or urbanization) in each region to pinpoint the major drivers. Results For the three taxa combined, we project a total loss of 9,472 million years (MY) of evolutionary history due to all land uses in all countries: 1,541 MY of mammal PD is at stake, 3,336 MY of bird PD and 4,595 MY of amphibian PD. Agriculture is responsible for loss of 1,579 MY; pasture 1990 MY, forestry 5,381 and urbanization 522. Land use in Indonesia, Colombia, India, Papua New Guinea, Madagascar and Philippines is projected to cause the most loss of PD. Main conclusions Through the integrated approach, we can now project PD loss associated with species extinctions under alternative land conversion scenarios in a region. Overall, the results on hotspots and land use drivers may inform individual nations in designing regional strategies to achieve the international biodiversity and sustainability targets.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Chaudhary","given":"Abhishek"},{"family":"Pourfaraj","given":"Vahab"},{"family":"Mooers","given":"Arne O."}],"citation-key":"Chaudhary2018_Projectingglobal","container-title":"Diversity and Distributions","DOI":"10.1111/ddi.12677","ISSN":"1472-4642","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","number":"2","page":"158-167","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Projecting global land use-driven evolutionary history loss","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ddi.12677","volume":"24"},{"id":"Chevallier2025_Organicmatters","author":[{"family":"Chevallier","given":"Tiphaine"}],"citation-key":"Chevallier2025_Organicmatters","event-title":"formation ecologie des sols","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",3,26]]},"title":"Organic matters and ecosystem services (Matières organiques et services ecosystémiques)","type":"speech"},{"id":"Clarholm1985_Interactionsbacteria","abstract":"The capacity of bacteria and protozoa to mineralize soil nitrogen was studied in microcosms with sterilized soil with or without wheat plants. The effect of small additions of glucose or ammonium nitrate or both, twice a week was also tested. Plant dry weight and N-content, number of microorganisms and biomass plus inorganic N were determined after 6 weeks. The introduction of plants profoundly influenced the N transformations. In the presence of root-derived carbon, much more N was mineralized from the organic matter and immobilized mainly in plant biomass. “Total observable change in biomass N plus inorganic N” was negative in the unvegetated soils without additions, while a mineralization of 1.7 mg N microcosm−1 was observed in microcosms with wheat plants grown with bacteria only. When protozoa were included, the N taken up by plants increased by 75%. Sugar additions resulted in an 18% increase of total N in the shoots when protozoa were present, but had no significant effect in the absence of grazers. Plants with the same root weight were more efficient in their uptake of inorganic N when protozoa were present. Plants grown with protozoa also had a lower R/S ratio, indicating a less stressed N availability situation. The lowest ratio was found with N additions in the presence of protozoa. The results indicate that, with energy supplied by plant roots or with external glucose additions, soil bacteria can mineralize N from the soil organic matter to support their own growth. Grazing of the bacteria is necessary to make bacterial biomass N available for plant uptake.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",3,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Clarholm","given":"Marianne"}],"citation-key":"Clarholm1985_Interactionsbacteria","container-title":"Soil Biology and Biochemistry","container-title-short":"Soil Biology and Biochemistry","DOI":"10.1016/0038-0717(85)90113-0","ISSN":"0038-0717","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["1985",1,1]]},"page":"181-187","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Interactions of bacteria, protozoa and plants leading to mineralization of soil nitrogen","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0038071785901130","volume":"17"},{"id":"Clemmensen2013_RootsAssociated","abstract":"Boreal forest soils function as a terrestrial net sink in the global carbon cycle.

In this study, 109 monitoring sites were investigated using a systematic framework (a 16 km 16 km regular grid). Six biological groups were studied within four major categories, i.e., macrofauna (all soil macro-invertebrate taxa and earthworms), mesofauna (Acari and Collembola), microfauna (nematodes), and micro-organisms (microbial biomass and functional genes). The abundances of earthworms, nematodes, Acari and the bacterial community (assessed by their encoded 16S rRNA) as well as microbial biomass and earthworm species richness discriminate land uses (crops from meadows from forests). Macro-invertebrate abundance, Collembola abundance and richness, and nematode richness are only relevant for the discrimination of agricultural practices (e.g., management system or fertilisation intensity). Most of the soil biological groups (except Collembola) exhibit lower values of abundance and community richness in croplands than in meadows. This programme allows us to set up a ﬁrst reference database for soil biological data for France covering microﬂora and fauna. This substantial reference database will be used to calibrate future research results and to develop management baseline values for stakeholders to assess the status of soil biodiversity under several policies, e.g., the Common Agricultural Policy, Soil Framework Directive, EU and national biodiversity strategies, and policies related to contaminated land management. Therefore it should assist stakeholders in the choice of good agricultural practices.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",6,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Cluzeau","given":"D."},{"family":"Guernion","given":"M."},{"family":"Chaussod","given":"R."},{"family":"Martin-Laurent","given":"F."},{"family":"Villenave","given":"C."},{"family":"Cortet","given":"J."},{"family":"Ruiz-Camacho","given":"N."},{"family":"Pernin","given":"C."},{"family":"Mateille","given":"T."},{"family":"Philippot","given":"L."},{"family":"Bellido","given":"A."},{"family":"Rougé","given":"L."},{"family":"Arrouays","given":"D."},{"family":"Bispo","given":"A."},{"family":"Pérès","given":"G."}],"citation-key":"Cluzeau2012_IntegrationBiodiversity","container-title":"European Journal of Soil Biology","container-title-short":"European Journal of Soil Biology","DOI":"10.1016/j.ejsobi.2011.11.003","ISSN":"11645563","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",3]]},"language":"en","license":"https://www.elsevier.com/tdm/userlicense/1.0/","page":"63-72","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Integration of biodiversity in soil quality monitoring: Baselines for microbial and soil fauna parameters for different land-use types","title-short":"Integration of biodiversity in soil quality monitoring","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1164556311001130","volume":"49"},{"id":"Colquhoun2019_FalsePositive","abstract":"It is widely acknowledged that the biomedical literature suffers from a surfeit of false positive results.

It is hopeless to expect users to change their reliance on p-values unless they are offered an alternative way of judging the reliability of their conclusions. If the alternative method is to have a chance of being adopted widely, it will have to be easy to understand and to calculate. One such proposal is based on calculation of false positive risk(FPR). It is suggested that p-values and confidence intervals should continue to be given, but that they should be supplemented by a single additional number that conveys the strength of the evidence better than the p-value. This number could be the minimum FPR (that calculated on the assumption of a prior probability of 0.5, the largest value that can be assumed in the absence of hard prior data).

Using the same methods as in the 1997 paper but with updated data, the estimate for the total global ecosystem services in 2011 is $125trillion/yr (assuming updated unit values and changes to biome areas) and $145trillion/yr (assuming only unit values changed), both in 2007 $US.

Increasing its stocks can significantly contribute to climate change mitigation and the sustainability of agricultural production. Elucidating the mechanisms and drivers of the formation of the main components of SOM, particulate (POM) and mineral associated (MAOM) organic matter, from the decomposition of plant inputs is therefore critical to inform management and policy designed to promote SOM regeneration. We designed a two-tiered laboratory incubation experiment using 13C and 15N labeled plant material to investigate the effects of the physical nature (i.e., structural versus soluble) of plant inputs as well as their chemical composition on (1) the pathways of SOM formation, (2) the soil microbial community and chemical diversity, and (3) their interaction on the stabilization efficiency of litter-derived C in POM and MAOM, in a topsoil and a subsoil. We found that: i) the physical nature of the plant input (structural vs soluble) drove both the pathways and efficiencies of SOM formation; ii) POM formation from the decomposition of structural residues increased in efficiency the more decomposed were the residues, and linearly with soil microbial and chemical diversity, the latter only for subsoil; ii) more input-derived C and N were retained in subsoil because of both higher stabilization in MAOM and POM, and slower residue decay. Our results also confirm the importance of direct sorption of soluble inputs to silt- and clay-sized minerals for the formation of MAOM in bulk soils. Taken together these finding suggest that the highest potential for SOM accrual is in subsoils characterized by higher C saturation deficit, from the separate addition of decomposed residues and soluble plant inputs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",6,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Cotrufo","given":"M.

Due to the complex nature of food production and consumption system, quantifying the impacts of food supply chains on biodiversity is challenging. Life cycle assessment (LCA) allows for systematically addressing environmental impacts along supply chains, representing a reference methodology that can be applied for assessing food systems. In the present study, 32 representative food products of consumption in the European Union (EU) were selected and their environmental impacts calculated through a process-based LCA. The potential contribution of EU food consumption to the current biodiversity decline has been evaluated adopting both midpoint and endpoint indicators. A comparison of the impact drivers was performed. Meat products, the underpinning land use for agricultural purposes, and climate change represent the main hotspots of impacts on biodiversity. Notwithstanding several drivers of biodiversity loss can be accounted for with LCA, the evidence of the increasing biodiversity decline on both a European and a global scale indicates that the assessment system should be further expanded, especially for what concerns reﬁning impact categories such as ecotoxicity, and including resource overexploitation, and impact due to invasive species. This study illustrates: how far the current LCA based impact assessment framework may help to address the drivers of biodiversity loss; which are the main uncertainties associated to results stemming from the application of different endpoint methods; which aspects need to be elaborated further to ensure a comprehensive assessment of biodiversity impacts due to food production and consumption.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Crenna","given":"Eleonora"},{"family":"Sinkko","given":"T."},{"family":"Sala","given":"Serenella"}],"citation-key":"Crenna2019_Biodiversityimpacts","container-title":"Journal of Cleaner Production","container-title-short":"Journal of Cleaner Production","DOI":"10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.04.054","ISSN":"09596526","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",8]]},"language":"en","page":"378-391","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Biodiversity impacts due to food consumption in Europe","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S095965261931131X","volume":"227"},{"id":"Crenna2020_BiodiversityAssessment","abstract":"The consumption of materials and products is one of the drivers of biodiversity loss, which in turn aﬀects ecosystem functioning and has socio-economic consequences worldwide. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a reference methodology for appraising the environmental impacts of products along their value chains. Currently, a generally accepted life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) framework for assessing biodiversity impacts is lacking. The existing LCIA models present weaknesses in terms of the impact drivers considered, geographical coverage, as well as the indicators and metrics adopted. Sound ecological indicators and metrics need to be integrated in order to better assess the impacts of value chains on biodiversity on a global, regional, and local scale. This review analyses studies which, using a life cycle perspective, assess the impacts of products’ and services’ value chains on biodiversity. We identify and discuss promising synergies between the studies which look beyond the life cycle context, and apply other biodiversity metrics. Our results highlight that the existing metrics of biodiversity impact assessment in LCA are poor at capturing the complexities of biodiversity. There are operational models at the midpoint level that expand on the assessed dimensions of biodiversity (e.g., ecosystem structure), and the drivers of biodiversity loss (e.g., assessment of species exploitation), but eﬀorts are required to fully include these models in the LCA framework. In the business domain, many initiatives are developing frameworks to assess impacts on biodiversity. Many approaches make use of LCIA methods and input−output databases. However, these are generally coupled with other biodiversity metrics. This shows that the current LCA framework is not yet suﬃcient to support decision-making based on diﬀerent sets of biodiversity indicators. Ecosystem accounting may provide important ecological information for both the inventory and the impact assessment stages of LCA, helping to disentangle the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem services. Looking beyond the LCA domain can lead us to new ways of advancing the coverage of biodiversity impacts, in a way that increases the relevance of LCA across a wider range of areas. Future work should assess the indicators provided in various policy contexts.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Crenna","given":"Eleonora"},{"family":"Marques","given":"Alexandra"},{"family":"La Notte","given":"Alessandra"},{"family":"Sala","given":"Serenella"}],"citation-key":"Crenna2020_BiodiversityAssessment","container-title":"Environmental Science & Technology","container-title-short":"Environ.

Recent methodological proposals for life cycle impact assessment (LCIA), evaluate water use impacts on freshwater habitats based on river hydraulic parameters alterations. However, they are limited to French rivers due to lack of global data and models. On this basis, this article proposes an approach to compute regionalized characterization factors for modeling river habitat change potential (HCP) induced by water consumption, potentially applicable worldwide. A simplified model is developed for fish guilds and invertebrates. Based on French datasets, it establishes a relationship between HCP and river hydraulic parameters. A methodology to derive discharge and hydraulic geometry at the reach scale is proposed and applied to European and Middle Eastern rivers below 60°N latitude. Regionalized HCPs are calculated at the river reach scale and aggregated at watershed. Then, the impact of agricultural water use in contrasted European and Middle Eastern countries is evaluated comparing the outcomes from the HCP and the Available Water Remaining (AWARE) models at the national scale, considering water supply mix data. The same analysis is carried out on selected river basins. Finally, result consistency, uncertainty and global applicability of the overall approach are discussed. The study demonstrates the reproducibility of the impact model developed for French rivers on any hydrographic network where comparable ecological, hydrological and hydraulic conditions are met. Furthermore, it highlights the need to characterize impacts at a higher spatial resolution in areas where HCP is higher. Large scale quantification of HCP opens the way to the operationalization of mechanistic LCIA models in which the habitat preferences of freshwater species are taken into account to assess the impacts of water consumption on biodiversity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",5,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Damiani","given":"Mattia"},{"family":"Roux","given":"Philippe"},{"family":"Loiseau","given":"Eléonore"},{"family":"Lamouroux","given":"Nicolas"},{"family":"Pella","given":"Hervé"},{"family":"Morel","given":"Maxime"},{"family":"Rosenbaum","given":"Ralph K."}],"citation-key":"Damiani2021_highresolutionlife","container-title":"Science of The Total Environment","container-title-short":"Science of The Total Environment","DOI":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.146664","ISSN":"0048-9697","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",8,15]]},"page":"146664","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"A high-resolution life cycle impact assessment model for continental freshwater habitat change due to water consumption","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969721017320","volume":"782"},{"id":"Damiani2023_Criticalreview","abstract":"Global biodiversity is in rapid decline and halting biodiversity loss is one of the most important challenges humanity must tackle now and in the immediate future. The five main direct drivers of biodiversity loss are climate change, pollution, land use, overexploitation of resources and the spread of invasive species, which result from indirect drivers such as unsustainable production and consumption. It is therefore of paramount importance that scientifically robust methods are developed to capture impacts on biodiversity from a value-chain perspective. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology allows to quantify the impact of products and organisations throughout their whole life cycle. In the LCA framework, several methods for biodiversity impact assessment have been developed. Building on previous reviews, this article aims to critically analyse methods and models for biodiversity impact assessment in LCA and beyond as comprehensively as possible, and to select those that may be most suitable for application in an LCA context. 64 methods were reviewed and 23 were selected for a detailed analysis based on availability of documentation, domain of application, geographical scope, potential to be used in LCA, and added value. The analysis addressed their goal and scope, data use and needs, and impact assessment characteristics, revealing strengths and weaknesses of the methods. There is currently no method that takes well into account at the same time the variety of pressures on biodiversity, ecosystems, taxonomic groups, essential biodiversity variables classes, and the fundamental aspects to consider in biodiversity impact assessments – but for each of these five criteria, we show which methods perform best. For the future development of biodiversity impact assessment, it is required to improve the coverage of drivers of biodiversity loss, increase ecosystem and taxonomic coverage, include the assessment of ecosystem services, and develop robust indicators that allow for complementary analysis of more essential biodiversity aspects.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Damiani","given":"Mattia"},{"family":"Sinkko","given":"Taija"},{"family":"Caldeira","given":"Carla"},{"family":"Tosches","given":"Davide"},{"family":"Robuchon","given":"Marine"},{"family":"Sala","given":"Serenella"}],"citation-key":"Damiani2023_Criticalreview","container-title":"Environmental Impact Assessment Review","container-title-short":"Environmental Impact Assessment Review","DOI":"10.1016/j.eiar.2023.107134","ISSN":"01959255","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",7]]},"language":"en","page":"107134","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Critical review of methods and models for biodiversity impact assessment and their applicability in the LCA context","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0195925523001002","volume":"101"},{"id":"deBaan2013_Landuse","abstract":"Purpose Land use is a main driver of global biodiversity loss and its environmental relevance is widely recognized in re- search on life cycle assessment (LCA). The inherent spatial heterogeneity of biodiversity and its non-uniform response to land use requires a regionalized assessment, whereas many LCA applications with globally distributed value chains re- quire a global scale. This paper presents a first approach to quantify land use impacts on biodiversity across different world regions and highlights uncertainties and research needs. Methods The study is based on the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)/Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry (SETAC) land use assessment framework and focuses on occupation impacts, quantified as a biodiversity damage potential (BDP). Species richness of different land use types was compared to a (semi-)natural regional reference situation to calculate relative changes in species richness. Data on multiple species groups were de- rived from a global quantitative literature review and national biodiversity monitoring data from Switzerland. Differences across land use types, biogeographic regions (i.e., biomes), species groups and data source were statistically analyzed. For a data subset from the biome (sub-)tropical moist broadleaf forest, different species-based biodiversity indicators were calculated and the results compared. Results and discussion An overall negative land use impact was found for all analyzed land use types, but results varied considerably. Different land use impacts across biogeo- graphic regions and taxonomic groups explained some of the variability. The choice of indicator also strongly influ- enced the results. Relative species richness was less sensi- tive to land use than indicators that considered similarity of species of the reference and the land use situation. Possible sources of uncertainty, such as choice of indicators and taxonomic groups, land use classification and regionaliza- tion are critically discussed and further improvements are suggested. Data on land use impacts were very unevenly distributed across the globe and considerable knowledge gaps on cause–effect chains remain. Conclusions The presented approach allows for a first rough quantification of land use impact on biodiversity in LCA on a global scale. As biodiversity is inherently hetero- geneous and data availability is limited, uncertainty of the results is considerable. The presented characterization fac- tors for BDP can approximate land use impacts on biodi- versity in LCA studies that are not intended to directly support decision-making on land management practices. For such studies, more detailed and site-dependent assessments are required. To assess overall land use impacts, transforma- tion impacts should additionally be quantified. Therefore, more accurate and regionalized data on regeneration times of ecosystems are needed","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Baan","given":"Laura","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Alkemade","given":"Rob"},{"family":"Koellner","given":"Thomas"}],"citation-key":"deBaan2013_Landuse","container-title":"The International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment","container-title-short":"Int J Life Cycle Assess","DOI":"10.1007/s11367-012-0412-0","ISSN":"0948-3349, 1614-7502","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013"]]},"language":"en","license":"http://www.springer.com/tdm","number":"6","page":"1216-1230","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Land use impacts on biodiversity in LCA: a global approach","title-short":"Land use impacts on biodiversity in LCA","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11367-012-0412-0","volume":"18"},{"id":"deBaan2013_LandUsea","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Baan","given":"Laura","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Mutel","given":"Christopher L."},{"family":"Curran","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Hellweg","given":"Stefanie"},{"family":"Koellner","given":"Thomas"}],"citation-key":"deBaan2013_LandUsea","container-title":"Environmental Science & Technology","container-title-short":"Environ.

In this paper, we develop a high-resolution (900 m) assessment method for land use impacts on biodiversity based on habitat suitability models (HSM) of mammal species. This method considers potential land use effects on individual species, and impacts are weighted by the species’ conservation status and global rarity. We illustrate the method using a case study of crop production in East Africa, but the underlying HSMs developed by the Global Mammals Assessment are available globally. We calculate impacts of three major export crops and compare the results to two previously developed methods (focusing on local and regional impacts, respectively) to assess the relevance of the methodological innovations proposed in this paper.

Due to the spatial heterogeneity of soil properties and the global nature of most value chains, the modelling of the impacts of land use on soil quality for application in life cycle assessment (LCA) requires a regionalised assessment with global coverage. This paper proposes an approach to quantify the impacts of land use on soil quality, using changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks as a proxy, following the latest recommendation of the Life Cycle Initiative.\nMethods An operational set of SOC-based characterisation factors for land occupation and land transformation were derived using spatial datasets (1 km resolution) and aggregated at the national and global levels. The developed characterisation factors were tested by means of a case study analysis, investigating the impact on soil quality caused by land use activities necessary to provide three alternative energy supply systems for passenger car transport (biomethane, ethanol, and solar electricity). Results obtained by applying characterisation factors at local, regional, and national levels were compared, to investigate the role of the level of regionalisation on the resulting impacts.\nResults and discussion Global maps of characterisation factors are presented for the 56 land use types commonly used in LCA databases, together with national and global values. Urban and industrial land uses present the highest impacts on SOC stocks, followed by severely degraded pastures and intensively managed arable lands. Instead, values obtained for extensive pastures, flooded crops, and urban green areas often report an increase in SOC stocks. Results show that the ranking of impacts of the three energy systems considered in the case study analysis is not affected by the level of regionalisation of the analysis. In the case of biomethane energy supply, impacts assessed using national characterisation factors are more than double those obtained with local characterisation factors, with less significant differences in the other two cases.\nConclusions The integration of soil quality aspects in life cycle impact assessment methods is a crucial challenge due to the key role of soil conservation in ensuring food security and environmental protection. This approach allows the quantification of land use impacts on SOC stocks, taken as a proxy of soil quality. Further research needs to improve the assessment of land use impacts in LCA are identified, such as the ability to reflect the effects of agricultural and forestry management practices.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,5]]},"author":[{"family":"De Laurentiis","given":"Valeria"},{"family":"Maier","given":"Stephanie"},{"family":"Horn","given":"Rafael"},{"family":"Uusitalo","given":"Ville"},{"family":"Hiederer","given":"Roland"},{"family":"Chéron-Bessou","given":"Cécile"},{"family":"Morais","given":"Tiago"},{"family":"Grant","given":"Tim"},{"family":"Milà i Canals","given":"Llorenç"},{"family":"Sala","given":"Serenella"}],"citation-key":"DeLaurentiis2024_Soilorganic","container-title":"The International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment","container-title-short":"Int J Life Cycle Assess","DOI":"10.1007/s11367-024-02307-9","ISSN":"0948-3349, 1614-7502","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",7]]},"language":"en","number":"7","page":"1190-1208","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Soil organic carbon as an indicator of land use impacts in life cycle assessment","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11367-024-02307-9","volume":"29"},{"id":"Depraz2013_Notionproteger","abstract":"La protection de la nature est un domaine en apparence simple, tant il est vrai que la  sauvegarde des espèces ou des milieux naturels est devenue une préoccupation courante de la société contemporaine dans sa gestion des territoires.

In an attempt to shed light on this topic, the originality of this article lies in its intention to provide a balanced description of contradictory scientific opinions on soil carbon storage and to examine how the scientific community can support decision-making despite the controversy. In the first part, we review and attempt to reconcile conflicting views on the mechanisms controlling organic carbon dynamics in soil. We discuss the divergent opinions about chemical recalcitrance, the microbial or plant origin of persistent soil organic matter, the contribution of particulate organic matter to additional organic carbon storage in soil, and the spatial and energetic inaccessibility of soil organic matter to decomposers. In the second part, we examine the advantages and limitations of big data management and modeling, which are essential tools to link the latest scientific theories with the actions taken by stakeholders.

Understanding how these ecosystem services – and the ecosystem properties underpinning them – respond to drivers of change is therefore an urgent priority. We address this challenge through developing a novel risk-assessment framework that integrates ecological and evolutionary perspectives on functional traits to determine species’ effects on ecosystems and their tolerance of environmental changes. We define Specific Effect Function (SEF) as the per-gram or per capita capacity of a species to affect an ecosystem property, and Specific Response Function (SRF) as the ability of a species to maintain or enhance its population as the environment changes. Our risk assessment is based on the idea that the security of ecosystem services depends on how effects (SEFs) and tolerances (SRFs) of organisms – which both depend on combinations of functional traits – correlate across species and how they are arranged on the species’ phylogeny. Four extreme situations are theoretically possible, from minimum concern when SEF and SRF are neither correlated nor show a phylogenetic signal, to maximum concern when they are negatively correlated (i.e., the most important species are the least tolerant) and phylogenetically patterned (lacking independent backup). We illustrate the assessment with five case studies, involving both plant and animal examples. However, the extent to which the frequency of the four plausible outcomes, or their intermediates, apply more widely in real-world ecological systems is an open question that needs empirical evidence, and suggests a research agenda at the interface of evolutionary biology and ecosystem ecology.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",3,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Díaz","given":"Sandra"},{"family":"Purvis","given":"Andy"},{"family":"Cornelissen","given":"Johannes H.

Degradation may reduce the number of microorganisms in the soil. Multiple activities and services provided by grassland ecosystems are impacted by land use change because of the resulting shifts in plant community composition and soil characteristics. A large body of research has examined the geographical and temporal dynamics of bacterial community structure and bacterial responses to human management in grassland ecosystems. As one of the most consequential environmental shifts occurring today, land use modification can affect microbial communities through modifying soil environmental parameters, nutritional conditions, and biological interactions. Whereas, soil microbes play crucial roles in nutrient cycling, organic matter decomposition, disease suppression, and overall soil health. Land degradation practices, such as deforestation, overgrazing, intensive agriculture, and improper land management, can disrupt the balance and diversity of soil microbial communities, leading to negative consequences for ecosystem functioning. To mitigate the negative effects of land degradation on soil microbial communities, sustainable land management practices should be adopted. These practices include soil conservation, reforestation, crop rotation, reduced tillage, organic farming methods, and proper nutrient management. By promoting soil health and restoring ecosystem processes, these approaches can help rebuild and maintain diverse and functional soil microbial communities. The purpose of this review is twofold: (1) to assess the diversity and composition of soil microorganisms in response to distinct land-use scenarios; and (2) to compare the relative importance of environmental factors driving these variations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",4,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Dixit","given":"Mahima"},{"family":"Ghoshal","given":"Debabrata"},{"family":"Lal Meena","given":"Amrit"},{"family":"Ghasal","given":"P.

Ecological responses are ineluctably complex, demanding measures that describe them succinctly. Collectively, these measures encapsulate the overall ‘stability’ of the system. Many international bodies, including the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, broadly aspire to maintain or enhance ecological stability. Such bodies frequently use terms pertaining to stability that lack clear deﬁnition. Consequently, we cannot measure them and so they disconnect from a large body of theoretical and empirical understanding. We assess the scientiﬁc and policy literature and show that this disconnect is one consequence of an inconsistent and one-dimensional approach that ecologists have taken to both disturbances and stability. This has led to confused communication of the nature of stability and the level of our insight into it. Disturbances and stability are multidimensional. Our understanding of them is not. We have a remarkably poor understanding of the impacts on stability of the characteristics that deﬁne many, perhaps all, of the most important elements of global change. We provide recommendations for theoreticians, empiricists and policymakers on how to better integrate the multidimensional nature of ecological stability into their research, policies and actions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",4,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Donohue","given":"Ian"},{"family":"Hillebrand","given":"Helmut"},{"family":"Montoya","given":"José M."},{"family":"Petchey","given":"Owen L."},{"family":"Pimm","given":"Stuart L."},{"family":"Fowler","given":"Mike S."},{"family":"Healy","given":"Kevin"},{"family":"Jackson","given":"Andrew L."},{"family":"Lurgi","given":"Miguel"},{"family":"McClean","given":"Deirdre"},{"family":"O'Connor","given":"Nessa E."},{"family":"O'Gorman","given":"Eoin J."},{"family":"Yang","given":"Qiang"}],"citation-key":"Donohue2016_Navigatingcomplexity","container-title":"Ecology Letters","container-title-short":"Ecology Letters","DOI":"10.1111/ele.12648","editor":[{"family":"Adler","given":"Frederick"}],"ISSN":"1461-023X, 1461-0248","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",9]]},"language":"en","page":"1172-1185","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Navigating the complexity of ecological stability","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ele.12648","volume":"19"},{"id":"Doolittle1999_PhylogeneticClassification","abstract":"From comparative analyses of the nucleotide sequences of genes encoding ribosomal RNAs and several proteins, molecular phylogeneticists have constructed a “universal tree of life,” taking it as the basis for a “natural” hierarchical classification of all living things.

Soil health, or quality, can be broadly deﬁned as the capacity of a living soil to function, within natural or managed ecosystem boundaries, to sustain plant and animal productivity, maintain or enhance water and air quality, and promote plant and animal health. Soil quality and health change over time due to natural events or human impacts. They are enhanced by management and land-use decisions that weigh the multiple functions of soil and are impaired by decisions which focus only on single functions, such as crop productivity. Criteria for indicators of soil quality and health relate mainly to their utility in deﬁning ecosystem processes and in integrating physical, chemical, and biological properties; their sensitivity to management and climatic variations; and their accessibility and utility to agricultural specialists, producers, conservationists, and policy makers. Although soils have an inherent quality as related to their physical, chemical, and biological properties within the constraints set by climate and ecosystems, the ultimate determinant of soil quality and health is the land manager. As such, the assessment of soil quality or health, and direction of change with time, is the primary indicator of sustainable management. Scientists can make a signiﬁcant contribution to sustainable land management by translating scientiﬁc knowledge and information on soil function into practical tools and approaches by which land managers can assess the sustainability of their management practices. The ﬁrst steps, however, in our communal journey towards sustainable land management must be the identiﬁcation of our ﬁnal destination (sustainability goals), the strategies or course by which we will get there, and the indicators (benchmarks) that we are proceeding in the right direction. We too often rush to raise the sails of our ‘technological’ ship to catch the wind, before knowing from where it comes or in properly deﬁning our destination, charting our course, and setting the rudder of our ship.

It is essential that we understand these links and the consequences of biodiversity loss for the various global challenges we currently face, including food insecurity and malnutrition, climate change, poverty and diseases. The Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development sets out a transformative approach to achieve socio-economic development while conserving the environment.  There is increasing attention on the importance of biodiversity for food security and nutrition, especially above-ground biodiversity such as plants and animals. However, less attention is being paid to the biodiversity beneath our feet, soil biodiversity. Yet, the rich diversity of soil organisms drives many processes that produce food, regenerate soil or purify water.  In 2002, the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) decided at its 6th meeting to establish an International Initiative for the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Soil Biodiversity and since then, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) has been facilitating this initiative. In 2012, FAO members established the Global Soil Partnership to promote sustainable soil management and increase attention to this hidden resource. The Status of the World’s Soil Resources (FAO, 2015) concluded that the loss of soil biodiversity is considered one of the main global threats to soils in many regions of the world.  The 14th Conference of the Parties invited FAO, in collaboration with other organizations, to consider the preparation of a report on the state of knowledge on soil biodiversity covering its current status, challenges and potentialities.

At present, there is no common consensus on the best practice for quantification of land use in LCA. However, land use and its consequences for biodiversity and ecosystem services are currently subject to intense public debate. Here, we review relevant methodology proposed to date with special reference to the hemeroby concept to identify a consistent method that captures the complexity of land use without oversimplification and loss of crucial information. Methods The definition of the safeguard subject is of vital importance and predetermines the framework of all methods and requirements for a reliable impact indicator. We selected naturalness as the safeguard subject and identified the hemeroby concept as the most appropriate approach for quantification. The hemeroby concept is particularly well suited for a nuanced assessment of different types of land use management. Results With the application of a system of seven ordinal classes, the diversity of naturalness in forestry and agricultural production systems can be adequately characterised. The applicability of the classification system of the hemeroby concept was reviewed and aspects in need of further development and method refinement were identified. Furthermore, the hemeroby concept was compared to other common concepts for the integration of land use into LCIA. Discussion The hemeroby concept was identified as an appropriate approach to quantify the safeguard subject naturalness as an LCIA indicator. In addition, it addresses subjects like biodiversity and intact ecosystems. Characterising the quality of utilised land by classes encompassing ranges on an ordinal scale offers considerable merits in comparison with single value systems on a cardinal scale. Such systems tend to oversimplify the highly complex variable land use by assuming a single quantifiable ecological indicator (e.g. soil carbon content or relative α-biodiversity) as representative proxy. In contrast to this, the hemeroby concept offers an approach that is able to retain sufficient complexity of the information available for a particular area, yet condense this information so that it may be modelled for LCA purposes without loss of crucial data. Conclusions Among all the methods currently available for the quantification of land use, the hemeroby concept is the most promising in terms of practicality of the actual method and quality of the output data. The classification into hemeroby classes is superior at capturing the complexity of land use. The method has been applied successfully in the area of European forests and agriculture. However, global availability of spatial hemeroby data and their compatibility with the criteria stipulated here needs to be evaluated and further developed as necessary. Other approaches focus on a different safeguard subject, thus narrowing the scope of land use as an impact indicator.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Fehrenbach","given":"Horst"},{"family":"Grahl","given":"Birgit"},{"family":"Giegrich","given":"Jürgen"},{"family":"Busch","given":"Mirjam"}],"citation-key":"Fehrenbach2015_Hemerobyimpact","container-title":"The International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment","container-title-short":"Int J Life Cycle Assess","DOI":"10.1007/s11367-015-0955-y","ISSN":"1614-7502","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",11,1]]},"language":"en","license":"2015 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg","number":"11","page":"1511-1527","publisher":"Springer Berlin Heidelberg","source":"link.springer.com","title":"Hemeroby as an impact category indicator for the integration of land use into life cycle (impact) assessment","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11367-015-0955-y","volume":"20"},{"id":"Fernandez-Ugalde2022_LUCAS2018","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",5,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Fernandez-Ugalde","given":"Oihane"},{"family":"Scarpa","given":"S."},{"family":"Orgiazzi","given":"Alberto"},{"family":"Panagos","given":"Panos"},{"family":"Liedekerke","given":"M.","non-dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Marechal","given":"A."},{"family":"Jones","given":"Arwyn"}],"citation-key":"Fernandez-Ugalde2022_LUCAS2018","event-place":"LU","ISBN":"978-92-76-54832-4, doi:v10.2760/215013,","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"language":"en","note":"JRC129926\nEUR 31144 EN","publisher":"Publications Office of the European Union","publisher-place":"LU","source":"DOI.org (CSL JSON)","title":"LUCAS 2018 soil module: presentation of dataset and results.","title-short":"LUCAS 2018 soil module","type":"report","URL":"https://data.europa.eu/doi/10.2760/215013"},{"id":"Field2020_Mycorrhizaschanging","abstract":"Societal Impact Statement Mycorrhizal fungi are of huge significance for plants, people, and the planet. In addition to the fruiting bodies of many mycorrhizal fungi having great culinary, medical, and sometimes religious significance, by forming partnerships with the vast majority of land plants, mycorrhizal fungi are essential in the formation and functioning of global ecosystems. As such, mycorrhizas have great potential for future exploitation and management to facilitate a variety of sustainability programs in agriculture, conservation, and restoration, considerations that are particularly relevant during this time of global change and widespread depletion of natural resources. Summary Mycorrhizal fungi, of all types, hold huge significance for our planet and society. By forming mutualistic symbioses with the vast majority of land plants, mycorrhizas play an essential role in the formation and maintenance of global ecosystems. They also have great potential for exploitation to facilitate a variety of sustainability programs in agriculture, conservation, and restoration, particularly relevant in the context of global climate change and depletion of natural resources. As such, in addition to the fruiting bodies of many mycorrhiza-forming fungal species being delicious, mycorrhizal symbioses are of critical and increasingly appreciated importance to human society.

To address this critical gap, we conducted a meta-analysis of published data (> 1300 datapoints) to compare belowground plant, microbial and faunal biomass across seven of the major biomes on Earth. We also assembled data to assess biome-level patterns in belowground microbial community composition. Our analysis suggests that variation in microbial biomass is predictable across biomes, with microbial biomass carbon representing 0.6–1.1% of soil organic carbon (r2 = 0.91) and 1–20% of total plant biomass carbon (r2 = 0.42). Approximately 50% of total animal biomass can be found belowground and soil faunal biomass represents < 4% of microbial biomass across all biomes. The structure of belowground microbial communities is also predictable: bacterial community composition and fungal : bacterial gene ratios can be predicted reasonably well from soil pH and soil C : N ratios respectively. Together these results identify robust patterns in the structure of belowground microbial and faunal communities at broad scales which may be explained by universal mechanisms that regulate belowground biota across biomes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",3,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Fierer","given":"Noah"},{"family":"Strickland","given":"Michael S."},{"family":"Liptzin","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Bradford","given":"Mark A."},{"family":"Cleveland","given":"Cory C."}],"citation-key":"Fierer2009_Globalpatterns","container-title":"Ecology Letters","DOI":"10.1111/j.1461-0248.2009.01360.x","ISSN":"1461-0248","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS","number":"11","page":"1238-1249","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Global patterns in belowground communities","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2009.01360.x","volume":"12"},{"id":"Finnveden2009_Recentdevelopments","abstract":"Life Cycle Assessment is a tool to assess the environmental impacts and resources used throughout a product's life cycle, i.e., from raw material acquisition, via production and use phases, to waste management.

To investigate this issue, two contrasted sites located in cultivated environments in France were studied. In the first site, soil samples were collected (n = 30) in plots for which the crop rotation history was documented since 1975. In the second site, samples were collected (n = 40) to compare the abundance of currently observed taxa versus detected taxa in cropland and other land uses. The results showed that the last cultivated crop was detected in 100% of the samples as the most abundant. In addition, weeds were the most abundant taxa identified in both sites. Overall, these results illustrate the potential of eDNA analyses for identifying the recent (< 10 years) land cover history of soils and outline the detection of different taxa in cultivated plots. The capacity of detection of plant species grown on soils delivering sediments to lacustrine systems is promising to improve our understanding of sediment transfer processes over short timescales.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",4,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Foucher","given":"Anthony"},{"family":"Evrard","given":"Olivier"},{"family":"Ficetola","given":"G.

Here we describe and synthesise datasets and methodologies to quantify the five major components of the global carbon budget and their uncertainties. Fossil CO<sub>2</sub> emissions (E<sub>FOS</sub>) are based on energy statistics and cement production data, while emissions from land-use change (E<sub>LUC</sub>) are based on land-use and land-use change data and bookkeeping models. Atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration is measured directly, and its growth rate (G<sub>ATM</sub>) is computed from the annual changes in concentration. The ocean CO<sub>2</sub> sink (S<sub>OCEAN</sub>) is estimated with global ocean biogeochemistry models and observation-based <em>f</em>CO<sub>2</sub>-products. The terrestrial CO<sub>2</sub> sink (S<sub>LAND</sub>) is estimated with dynamic global vegetation models. Additional lines of evidence on land and ocean sinks are provided by atmospheric inversions, atmospheric oxygen measurements and Earth System Models. The sum of all sources and sinks results in the carbon budget imbalance (B<sub>IM</sub>), a measure of imperfect data and incomplete understanding of the contemporary carbon cycle. All uncertainties are reported as &plusmn;1&sigma;.</p> <p>For the year 2023, E<sub>FOS</sub> increased by 1.3 % relative to 2022, with fossil emissions at 10.1 &plusmn; 0.5 GtC yr<sup>-1</sup> (10.3 &plusmn; 0.5 GtC yr<sup>-1</sup> when the cement carbonation sink is not included), E<sub>LUC</sub> was 1.0 &plusmn; 0.7 GtC yr<sup>-1</sup>, for a total anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> emission (including the cement carbonation sink) of 11.1 &plusmn; 0.9 GtC yr<sup>-1</sup> (40.6 &plusmn; 3.2 GtCO<sub>2</sub> yr<sup>-1</sup>). Also, for 2023, G<sub>ATM</sub> was 5.9 &plusmn; 0.2 GtC yr<sup>-1</sup> (2.79 &plusmn; 0.1 ppm yr<sup>-1</sup>), S<sub>OCEAN</sub> was 2.9 &plusmn; 0.4 GtC yr<sup>-1</sup> and S<sub>LAND</sub> was 2.3 &plusmn; 1.0 GtC yr<sup>-1</sup>, with a near zero B<sub>IM</sub> (-0.02 GtC yr<sup>-1</sup>). The global atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration averaged over 2023 reached 419.3 &plusmn; 0.1 ppm. Preliminary data for 2024, suggest an increase in E<sub>FOS</sub> relative to 2023 of +0.8 % (-0.3 % to 1.9 %) globally, and atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration increased by 2.8 ppm reaching 422.5 ppm, 52 % above pre-industrial level (around 278 ppm in 1750). Overall, the mean and trend in the components of the global carbon budget are consistently estimated over the period 1959&ndash;2023, with a near-zero overall budget imbalance, although discrepancies of up to around 1 GtC yr<sup>-1</sup> persist for the representation of annual to semi-decadal variability in CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes. Comparison of estimates from multiple approaches and observations shows: (1) a persistent large uncertainty in the estimate of land-use changes emissions, (2) a low agreement between the different methods on the magnitude of the land CO<sub>2</sub> flux in the northern extra-tropics, and (3) a discrepancy between the different methods on the mean ocean sink.</p> <p>This living data update documents changes in methods and datasets applied to this most-recent global carbon budget as well as evolving community understanding of the global carbon cycle.

Furthermore, the relative risk that each type of anthropogenic pressures places on the soil biota remains unclear.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Gardi","given":"Ciro"},{"family":"Jeffery","given":"Simon"},{"family":"Saltelli","given":"Andrea"}],"citation-key":"Gardi2013_estimatepotential","container-title":"Global Change Biology","container-title-short":"Global Change Biology","DOI":"10.1111/gcb.12159","ISSN":"1354-1013, 1365-2486","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",5]]},"language":"en","license":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/termsAndConditions#vor","number":"5","page":"1538-1548","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"An estimate of potential threats levels to soil biodiversity in EU","title-short":"An estimate of potential threats levels to soil biodiversity in <span style=\"font-variant","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.12159","volume":"19"},{"id":"Gaston2008_Commonnesspopulation","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",4,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Gaston","given":"K"},{"family":"Fuller","given":"R"}],"citation-key":"Gaston2008_Commonnesspopulation","container-title":"Trends in Ecology & Evolution","container-title-short":"Trends in Ecology & Evolution","DOI":"10.1016/j.tree.2007.11.001","ISSN":"01695347","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",1]]},"language":"en","license":"https://www.elsevier.com/tdm/userlicense/1.0/","page":"14-19","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Commonness, population depletion and conservation biology","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0169534707003205","volume":"23"},{"id":"GBF2025_A3Red","abstract":"Factsheet for headline indicator","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",7,7]]},"author":[{"literal":"GBF"}],"citation-key":"GBF2025_A3Red","container-title":"Indicators for the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework | Headline and Binary Indicators","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025"]]},"title":"A.3 Red List Index Indicator - Metadata Factsheet","type":"webpage","URL":"https://www.gbf-indicators.org/metadata/headline/A-3"},{"id":"Geisen2019_ChallengesOpportunities","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Geisen","given":"Stefan"},{"family":"Wall","given":"Diana H."},{"family":"Van Der Putten","given":"Wim H."}],"citation-key":"Geisen2019_ChallengesOpportunities","container-title":"Current Biology","container-title-short":"Current Biology","DOI":"10.1016/j.cub.2019.08.007","ISSN":"09609822","issue":"19","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",10]]},"language":"en","number":"19","page":"R1036-R1044","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Challenges and Opportunities for Soil Biodiversity in the Anthropocene","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0960982219310231","volume":"29"},{"id":"GEOBON2025_WhatAre","abstract":"What are EBVs?","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",7,7]]},"author":[{"literal":"GEO BON"}],"citation-key":"GEOBON2025_WhatAre","container-title":"Group on Earth Observations Biodiversity Observation Network","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025"]]},"language":"en-US","title":"What are EBVs?","type":"webpage","URL":"https://geobon.org/ebvs/what-are-ebvs/"},{"id":"Geoconfluences2023_Geographie","abstract":"definition de geographie","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",7,2]]},"archive_location":"ISSN : 2492-7775","author":[{"literal":"Géoconfluences"}],"citation-key":"Geoconfluences2023_Geographie","container-title":"Géoconfluences","genre":"Terme","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",11]]},"language":"fr","license":"Sauf mention contraire, ressource sous licence CC 4.0 BY-NC-SA","publisher":"École normale supérieure de Lyon","title":"Géographie","type":"webpage","URL":"https://geoconfluences.ens-lyon.fr/glossaire/geographie"},{"id":"Gerard2025_Vers202250year","abstract":"Earthworms are key organisms in terrestrial ecosystems. They are found globally and provide significant ecological functions and ecosystem services, so their conservation should be a priority. Yet little is known about the large‐scale impacts of global change on earthworm diversity, species distribution, and assemblage structure. More importantly, there are no comprehensive data on changes over long periods of time. In the 1960s, Marcel Bouché conducted a study by sampling earthworm assemblages in 1399 locations in mainland France, including the island of Corsica. Through the #Vers2022 project, we achieved the resampling of 418 of these historical sites, creating the first dataset to assess the long‐term changes in earthworm assemblages at a large scale. This dataset includes Bouché (1972) assemblage data, with original taxon's names, absence data, and site descriptions, published in 1972 in French, which were still not freely accessible in a standardized, computerized format. It consists of 36,079 individual earthworm records from 1399 sites, documenting 127 species and subspecies between 1961 and 1970. Additionally, it provides the results of the #Vers2022 resurvey, which includes 11,137 individual records (22,344 including unidentified) from 418 resampled sites, documenting 122 species and subspecies between 2019 and 2023. We followed the framework of quasi‐permanent plots, ensuring that the environment was as similar as possible between the historical sampling and its current resampling. These sites were sampled using a standardized, reproducible, and quantitative protocol, unlike the historical sampling, which was qualitative. The dataset also includes information on the individual body mass of each specimen, the total earthworm biomass of each assemblage, and soil analysis data. Furthermore, this work presents the updated taxonomy of each taxon provided by Bouché, along with an assessment of each species name in view of current taxonomy, as well as proposed names for future studies utilizing these data. The #Vers2022 dataset represents a significant improvement in our understanding of French earthworm diversity and can be used to assess changes in diversity and assemblages over a span of more than 50 years, including patterns in individual body mass.

Furthermore, in tropical agricultural systems undergoing intensification, large numbers of farmers have limited access to inputs, and therefore the maintenance and enhancement of soil biodiversity may be particularly relevant to such farmers.

Life cycle assessment is currently used for assessing a wide range of products and activities, from ecolabeling to product design as well as energy systems, food production and transportation alternatives; it now clearly extends beyond only an assessment of end products. The current debate to which LCA is being subjected is closely linked to the involvement of stakeholders and the systematic use of quality assurance aspects, including peer review and uncertainty analyses.

Many authors nevertheless argue that there are a lack of satisfactory operational methods for quantifying the contributions of soils to the supply of ES. In this study, we review ES mapping studies that have taken the roles of soils in ES supply into account, and propose soil function assessment (SFA) methods approved by German Federal States in spatial planning procedures to use in assessments of ES supply. We found 181 ES mapping studies in which the roles of soils in ES supply were considered. At least one soil property was used as an indicator of soil-related ES in 60% of the publications, and 13% of the publications were mainly focused on the roles of soils in supplying ES. More than two soil functions were considered in a minority of cases, indicating that the multi-functionality of soils has barely been taken into account in previous ES studies. Several decades ago, the soil science community has adopted the concept of soil functions to bring different aspects of soil to the fore and to emphasize the multifunctionalities of soils and their vastly different chemical, physical, and biological properties. We provide a set of approved SFA methods that cover the multi-functionalities of soils and are applicable to ES supply assessments. We propose that this set of operational SFA methods is a starting point for quantifying how soil systems underpin the supply of a wide range of ES. The minimal soil dataset required for these SFA methods is relatively small, and much progress has been made nationally and globally over the last decade in improving soil data infrastructure and online access for end users. These improvements will facilitate the incorporation of SFA into ES studies and thereby improve information for land use decisions. We recommend that ES assessments include the essential and multifunctional roles of soils to promote sustainable land use.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",3,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Greiner","given":"Lucie"},{"family":"Keller","given":"Armin"},{"family":"Grêt-Regamey","given":"Adrienne"},{"family":"Papritz","given":"Andreas"}],"citation-key":"Greiner2017_Soilfunction","container-title":"Land Use Policy","container-title-short":"Land Use Policy","DOI":"10.1016/j.landusepol.2017.06.025","ISSN":"02648377","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",12]]},"language":"fr","page":"224-237","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Soil function assessment: review of methods for quantifying the contributions of soils to ecosystem services","title-short":"Soil function assessment","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0264837717305719","volume":"69"},{"id":"Grime1998_Benefitsplant","abstract":"1 It is useful to distinguish between the immediate effects of species richness on ecosystems and those which become apparent on a longer time scale, described here as filter and founder effects. 2 Relationships between plant diversity and ecosystem properties can be explored by classifying component species into three categories – dominants, subordinates and transients. Dominants recur in particular vegetation types, are relatively large, exhibit coarse-grained foraging for resources and, as individual species, make a substantial contribution to the plant biomass. Subordinates also show high fidelity of association with particular vegetation types but they are smaller in stature, forage on a more restricted scale and tend to occupy microhabitats delimited by the architecture and phenology of their associated dominants. Transients comprise a heterogeneous assortment of species of low abundance and persistence; a high proportion are juveniles of species that occur as dominants or subordinates in neighbouring ecosystems. 3 A ‘mass ratio’ theory proposes that immediate controls are in proportion to inputs to primary production, are determined to an overwhelming extent by the traits and functional diversity of the dominant plants and are relatively insensitive to the richness of subordinates and transients. Recent experiments support the mass ratio hypothesis and the conclusion of Huston (1997) that claims of immediate benefits of high species richness to ecosystem functions arise from misinterpretation of data. 4 Attribution of immediate control to dominants does not exclude subordinates and transients from involvement in the determination of ecosystem function and sustainability. Both are suspected to play a crucial, if intermittent, role by influencing the recruitment of dominants. Some subordinates may act as a filter influencing regeneration by dominants following major perturbations. 5 Transients originate from the seed rain and seed banks and provide an index of the pool of potential dominants and subordinates at specific sites. Where the landscape carousel operates against a background of declining diversity in the reservoir of colonizing transients, we may predict that a progressive loss of ecosystem functions will arise from the decline in the precision with which dominants can engage in the re-assembly and relocation of ecosystems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Grime","given":"J.

Human activities influence the biological productivity of land, altering material and energy flows in the biosphere. The human appropriation of net primary production (HANPP) is an integrated socioecological indicator quantifying effects of human-induced changes in productivity and harvest on ecological biomass flows. We discuss how HANPP is defined, measured, and interpreted. Two principal approaches for constructing HANPP assessments exist: (a) In an area-specific approach, HANPP serves as an indicator of land-use intensity, gauging impacts on terrestrial ecosystems in a defined area; and (b) the consumption-based “embodied HANPP” approach allows assessment of impacts related to individual products or the aggregate consumption of nation-states. The HANPP framework can help to estimate upper limits for the biosphere&apos;s capacity to provide humanity with biomass for food, fiber, and bioenergy and to analyze systemic feedbacks between the delivery of these resources. We outline HANPP&apos;s global patterns and trajectories and how HANPP relates to planetary boundaries, global resource use, and pressures on biodiversity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",4,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Haberl","given":"Helmut"},{"family":"Erb","given":"Karl-Heinz"},{"family":"Krausmann","given":"Fridolin"}],"citation-key":"Haberl2014_HumanAppropriation","container-title":"Annual Review of Environment and Resources","DOI":"10.1146/annurev-environ-121912-094620","ISSN":"1543-5938, 1545-2050","issue":"Volume 39, 2014","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",10,17]]},"language":"en","page":"363-391","publisher":"Annual Reviews","source":"www.annualreviews.org","title":"Human Appropriation of Net Primary Production: Patterns, Trends, and Planetary Boundaries","title-short":"Human Appropriation of Net Primary Production","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-environ-121912-094620","volume":"39"},{"id":"Hansen2021_MonitoringForest","abstract":"Signatory countries to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) are formulating goals and indicators through 2050 under the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF). Among the goals is increasing the integrity of ecosystems. The CBD is now seeking input toward a quantifiable definition of integrity and methods to track it globally. Here, we offer a schema for using Earth observations (EO) to monitor and evaluate global forest ecosystem integrity (EI). Our approach builds on three topics: the concept of EI, the use of satellite-based EO, and the use of “essential biodiversity variables” to monitor and report on it. Within this schema, EI is a measure of the structure, function, and composition of an ecosystem relative to the range of variation determined by climatic–geophysical environment. We use evaluation criteria to recommend eight potential indicators of EI that can be monitored around the globe using Earth Observations to support the efforts of nations to monitor and report progress to implement the post-2020 GBF. If operationalized, this schema should help Parties to the CBD take action and report progress on achieving ecosystem commitments during this decade.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",6,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Hansen","given":"Andrew J."},{"family":"Noble","given":"Benjamin P."},{"family":"Veneros","given":"Jaris"},{"family":"East","given":"Alyson"},{"family":"Goetz","given":"Scott J."},{"family":"Supples","given":"Christina"},{"family":"Watson","given":"James E.

Here we examine new evidence from various sources to derive an updated estimate of global fungal diversity. The rates and patterns in the description of new species from the 1750s show no sign of approaching an asymptote and even accelerated in the 2010s after the advent of molecular approaches to species delimitation. Species recognition studies of (semi-)cryptic species hidden in morpho-species complexes suggest a weighted average ratio of about an order of magnitude for the number of species recognized after and before such studies. New evidence also comes from extrapolations of plant:fungus ratios, with information now being generated from environmental sequence studies, including comparisons of molecular and fieldwork data from the same sites. We further draw attention to undescribed species awaiting discovery in biodiversity hot spots in the tropics, little-explored habitats (such as lichen-inhabiting fungi), and material in collections awaiting study. We conclude that the commonly cited estimate of 1.5 million species is conservative and that the actual range is properly estimated at 2.2 to 3.8 million. With 120,000 currently accepted species, it appears that at best just 8%, and in the worst case scenario just 3%, are named so far. Improved estimates hinge particularly on reliable statistical and phylogenetic approaches to analyze the rapidly increasing amount of environmental sequence data.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",3,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Hawksworth","given":"David L."},{"family":"Lücking","given":"Robert"}],"citation-key":"Hawksworth2017_FungalDiversity","container-title":"Microbiology Spectrum","DOI":"10.1128/microbiolspec.funk-0052-2016","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",7,28]]},"number":"4","page":"10.1128/microbiolspec.funk-0052-2016","publisher":"American Society for Microbiology","source":"journals.asm.org (Atypon)","title":"Fungal Diversity Revisited: 2.2 to 3.8 Million Species","title-short":"Fungal Diversity Revisited","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/microbiolspec.funk-0052-2016","volume":"5"},{"id":"Hazard2013_RoleLocal","abstract":"Arbuscular fungi have a major role in directing the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems yet little is known about their biogeographical distribution.

Trifolium repens and L. perenne supported contrasting communities of AMF, and the communities colonising each plant species were consistent across pasture habitats and over distance. Furthermore, L. perenne AMF communities grouped by soil type within pasture habitats. This is the largest and most comprehensive study that has investigated the landscape-scale distribution of AMF.

Achieving this long quest requires simplifying the complexity of species niches for which relevant morphological, behavioural, biochemical or life-history traits are often used as relevant proxies. Soil fauna is highly diverse and many classifications have been proposed to synthesize both the response of soil organisms to their environment and their effect on soil functioning. Here, we provide a critical overview of the characteristics and limitations of the existing classifications in soil ecology, and propose clarifications and alternatives to current practices. We summarise the similarities and differences in how classifications have been created and used in soil ecology. We propose a harmonization of the current concepts by properly defining ‘guilds’, ‘functional groups’ and ‘trophic groups’ as subcategories of ‘ecological groups’, with different purposes and distinguishing criteria. Finally, based on these concepts, we suggest a common framework to define classifications based on functional traits that allows a better and unified understanding of changes in soil biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",5,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Hedde","given":"Mickael"},{"family":"Blight","given":"Olivier"},{"family":"Briones","given":"Maria J.

Here, we use a modeling approach to investigate how changes in cropping practices influence the soil food web dynamics and it relates to that of soil functioning. In an experimental trial, we tested for change in topsoil food webs after shift from conventional to alternative practices (changes in tillage intensity, amount of residues returned and N fertilization rate). Samplings were made in 16 plots of a randomized complete block design during spring of year 0, 2 and 4 after the onset of the trial. Microorganisms, microfauna, mesofauna and macrofauna were sampled, identified and grouped into trophic groups. We built a general soil food web describing plausible carbon flows between these trophic groups and computed several network indices. At the same dates, soil functions linked to C and N dynamics were measured from soil samples. We used a COSTATIS analysis to investigate relationships between temporal sequences of soil functions and soil food web indices. Significant interactive effects of the date and of agricultural systems were found on the mean and the maximum trophic level, the bacterial-to-fungal path ratio, the total biomass and the way biomass accumulates across trophic levels, the number of trophic groups and the functional redundancy in trophic groups. Similarly, organic matter transformations and enzymatic activities showed differences across date and agricultural systems. Results show that temporal changes in soil food web structure and in soil processes related to N and C cycling co-vary following changes in agricultural management practices. Management practices related to tillage exerted stronger effects on soil food web functioning than those related to the export of crop residues or reduction in mineral N fertiliser. For instance, reduced tillage lead to more complex food webs, with increased C and N mineralization in the upper soil layer (0–5 cm), in which most of the residues accumulate. Our results provide insights on soil food webs temporal dynamics, even within a restricted panel of agricultural practices. Our results suggest that changes in agricultural practices influence feedbacks between organisms and the functions they perform, so that a temporal co-structure can be observed in the studied site. Such work could help better understand the mechanisms of resistance or ecological debt during agroecological transition, which could limit or delay expected Nature-based solutions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",5,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Hedde","given":"Mickael"},{"family":"Coudrain","given":"Valérie"},{"family":"Maron","given":"Pierre-Alain"},{"family":"Chauvat","given":"Matthieu"},{"family":"Cheviron","given":"Nathalie"},{"family":"Ekelund","given":"Flemming"},{"family":"Mougin","given":"Christian"},{"family":"Mary","given":"Bruno"},{"family":"Recous","given":"Sylvie"},{"family":"Villenave","given":"Cécile"},{"family":"Thébault","given":"Elisa"}],"citation-key":"Hedde2024_Cropmanagement","container-title":"Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment","container-title-short":"Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment","DOI":"10.1016/j.agee.2024.109058","ISSN":"01678809","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",8]]},"language":"en","page":"109058","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Crop management strategies shape the shared temporal dynamics of soil food web structure and functioning","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0167880924001762","volume":"370"},{"id":"Hedde2025_Diversityroles","author":[{"family":"Hedde","given":"Mickael"}],"citation-key":"Hedde2025_Diversityroles","event-title":"formation ecologie des sols","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",3,27]]},"language":"fr","title":"Diversity and roles in soil fauna (Diversité et rôles de la faune du sol)","type":"speech"},{"id":"Hedlund2014_MicrobialEndemism","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",6,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Hedlund","given":"Brian P."},{"family":"Staley","given":"James T."}],"citation-key":"Hedlund2014_MicrobialEndemism","container-title":"Microbial Diversity and Bioprospecting","DOI":"10.1128/9781555817770.ch22","editor":[{"family":"Bull","given":"Alan T."}],"event-place":"Washington, DC, USA","ISBN":"978-1-68367-217-3 978-1-55581-777-0 978-1-55581-267-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",4,9]]},"language":"en","page":"225-231","publisher":"ASM Press","publisher-place":"Washington, DC, USA","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Microbial Endemism and Biogeography","type":"chapter","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1128/9781555817770.ch22"},{"id":"Heijungs2024_ProbabilityStatistics","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",6,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Heijungs","given":"Reinout"}],"citation-key":"Heijungs2024_ProbabilityStatistics","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-031-49317-1","event-place":"Cham","ISBN":"978-3-031-49316-4 978-3-031-49317-1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024"]]},"language":"en","license":"https://www.springernature.com/gp/researchers/text-and-data-mining","publisher":"Springer International Publishing","publisher-place":"Cham","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Probability, Statistics and Life Cycle Assessment: Guidance for Dealing with Uncertainty and Sensitivity","title-short":"Probability, Statistics and Life Cycle Assessment","type":"book","URL":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-031-49317-1"},{"id":"Heijungs2025_Marginalaverage","abstract":"In the literature on LCA, one often finds the terms “marginal” and “average,” often in combination with words like “data,” “process,” “emission,” or “characterisation factor.” However, the meaning of these terms appears to differ between sources.

These changes in components of the Earth's biodiversity cause concern for ethical and aesthetic reasons, but they also have a strong potential to alter ecosystem properties and the goods and services they provide to humanity. Ecological experiments, observations, and theoretical developments show that ecosystem properties depend greatly on biodiversity in terms of the functional characteristics of organisms present in the ecosystem and the distribution and abundance of those organisms over space and time. Species effects act in concert with the effects of climate, resource availability, and disturbance regimes in influencing ecosystem properties. Human activities can modify all of the above factors; here we focus on modification of these biotic controls. The scientific community has come to a broad consensus on many aspects of the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, including many points relevant to management of ecosystems. Further progress will require integration of knowledge about biotic and abiotic controls on ecosystem properties, how ecological communities are structured, and the forces driving species extinctions and invasions. To strengthen links to policy and management, we also need to integrate our ecological knowledge with understanding of the social and economic constraints of potential management practices. Understanding this complexity, while taking strong steps to minimize current losses of species, is necessary for responsible management of Earth's ecosystems and the diverse biota they contain. Based on our review of the scientific literature, we are certain of the following conclusions: 1) Species' functional characteristics strongly influence ecosystem properties. Functional characteristics operate in a variety of contexts, including effects of dominant species, keystone species, ecological engineers, and interactions among species (e.g., competition, facilitation, mutualism, disease, and predation). Relative abundance alone is not always a good predictor of the ecosystem-level importance of a species, as even relatively rare species (e.g., a keystone predator) can strongly influence pathways of energy and material flows. 2) Alteration of biota in ecosystems via species invasions and extinctions caused by human activities has altered ecosystem goods and services in many well-documented cases. Many of these changes are difficult, expensive, or impossible to reverse or fix with technological solutions. 3) The effects of species loss or changes in composition, and the mechanisms by which the effects manifest themselves, can differ among ecosystem properties, ecosystem types, and pathways of potential community change. 4) Some ecosystem properties are initially insensitive to species loss because (a) ecosystems may have multiple species that carry out similar functional roles, (b) some species may contribute relatively little to ecosystem properties, or (c) properties may be primarily controlled by abiotic environmental conditions. 5) More species are needed to insure a stable supply of ecosystem goods and services as spatial and temporal variability increases, which typically occurs as longer time periods and larger areas are considered. We have high confidence in the following conclusions: 1) Certain combinations of species are complementary in their patterns of resource use and can increase average rates of productivity and nutrient retention. At the same time, environmental conditions can influence the importance of complementarity in structuring communities. Identification of which and how many species act in a complementary way in complex communities is just beginning. 2) Susceptibility to invasion by exotic species is strongly influenced by species composition and, under similar environmental conditions, generally decreases with increasing species richness. However, several other factors, such as propagule pressure, disturbance regime, and resource availability also strongly influence invasion success and often override effects of species richness in comparisons across different sites or ecosystems. 3) Having a range of species that respond differently to different environmental perturbations can stabilize ecosystem process rates in response to disturbances and variation in abiotic conditions. Using practices that maintain a diversity of organisms of different functional effect and functional response types will help preserve a range of management options. Uncertainties remain and further research is necessary in the following areas: 1) Further resolution of the relationships among taxonomic diversity, functional diversity, and community structure is important for identifying mechanisms of biodiversity effects. 2) Multiple trophic levels are common to ecosystems but have been understudied in biodiversity/ecosystem functioning research. The response of ecosystem properties to varying composition and diversity of consumer organisms is much more complex than responses seen in experiments that vary only the diversity of primary producers. 3) Theoretical work on stability has outpaced experimental work, especially field research. We need long-term experiments to be able to assess temporal stability, as well as experimental perturbations to assess response to and recovery from a variety of disturbances. Design and analysis of such experiments must account for several factors that covary with species diversity. 4) Because biodiversity both responds to and influences ecosystem properties, understanding the feedbacks involved is necessary to integrate results from experimental communities with patterns seen at broader scales. Likely patterns of extinction and invasion need to be linked to different drivers of global change, the forces that structure communities, and controls on ecosystem properties for the development of effective management and conservation strategies. 5) This paper focuses primarily on terrestrial systems, with some coverage of freshwater systems, because that is where most empirical and theoretical study has focused. While the fundamental principles described here should apply to marine systems, further study of that realm is necessary. Despite some uncertainties about the mechanisms and circumstances under which diversity influences ecosystem properties, incorporating diversity effects into policy and management is essential, especially in making decisions involving large temporal and spatial scales. Sacrificing those aspects of ecosystems that are difficult or impossible to reconstruct, such as diversity, simply because we are not yet certain about the extent and mechanisms by which they affect ecosystem properties, will restrict future management options even further. It is incumbent upon ecologists to communicate this need, and the values that can derive from such a perspective, to those charged with economic and policy decision-making.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",3,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Hooper","given":"D.

Its consideration in methods such as Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is complex and oftentimes requires experts to perform studies and understand results. This report focuses on land use impact assessment methods in LCA studies applied to forestry. It presents an in-depth investigation of the state of the art in forestry modelling and LCA, considering the EFISCEN space forest model, the UNEP/SETAC land use framework, the European Commissions’ Environmental footprint, and the Fraunhofer LANCA® framework. Building on these, recommendations are provided for the modelling framework, the improvement of existing and the introduction of new indicators. Improvements for LANCA® are presented and Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) as well as Human Appropriated Net Primary Production (HANPP) are introduced as new indicators. The improved framework is applied to an exemplary case study using different modelling approaches based on EFISCEN space. The findings are finally condensed in a recommendation section for developers, practitioners, stakeholders, and policymakers.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Horn","given":"Rafael"},{"family":"Maier","given":"Stephanie"},{"family":"Hong","given":"Sun Hea"},{"family":"Arets","given":"Eric"},{"family":"Schelhaas","given":"Mart-Jan"},{"family":"Lerink","given":"Bas"},{"family":"Bos","given":"Ulrike"}],"citation-key":"Horn2022_LandUse","DOI":"10.24406/PUBLICA-79","ISBN":"978-3-8396-1771-7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"language":"en","note":"Cepi (European association representing the paper industry)","publisher":"Fraunhofer Verlag","source":"DOI.org (Datacite)","title":"Land Use and Forestry in the Environmental Footprint","type":"report","URL":"https://publica.fraunhofer.de/handle/publica/417979"},{"id":"Hu2025_Introductiondeep","abstract":"Predicting species distributions and entire communities is crucial for ecologists, to enhance our understanding of the drivers behind species distributions and community assembly and to provide qu...","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",5,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Hu","given":"Yuqing"},{"family":"Si-Moussi","given":"Sara"},{"family":"Thuiller","given":"Wilfried"}],"citation-key":"Hu2025_Introductiondeep","container-title":"Methods in Ecology and Evolution","DOI":"10.1111/2041-210X.14466","ISSN":"2041-210X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"228-246","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","source":"besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com","title":"Introduction to deep learning methods for multi-species predictions","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/2041-210X.14466","volume":"16"},{"id":"Hudson2014_PREDICTSdatabase","abstract":"Biodiversity continues to decline in the face of increasing anthropogenic pressures such as habitat destruction, exploitation, pollution and introduction of alien species. Existing global databases of species’ threat status or population time series are dominated by charismatic species. The collation of datasets with broad taxonomic and biogeographic extents, and that support computation of a range of biodiversity indicators, is necessary to enable better understanding of historical declines and to project – and avert – future declines. We describe and assess a new database of more than 1.6 million samples from 78 countries representing over 28,000 species, collated from existing spatial comparisons of local-scale biodiversity exposed to different intensities and types of anthropogenic pressures, from terrestrial sites around the world. The database contains measurements taken in 208 (of 814) ecoregions, 13 (of 14) biomes, 25 (of 35) biodiversity hotspots and 16 (of 17) megadiverse countries. The database contains more than 1% of the total number of all species described, and more than 1% of the described species within many taxonomic groups – including flowering plants, gymnosperms, birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, beetles, lepidopterans and hymenopterans. The dataset, which is still being added to, is therefore already considerably larger and more representative than those used by previous quantitative models of biodiversity trends and responses. The database is being assembled as part of the PREDICTS project (Projecting Responses of Ecological Diversity In Changing Terrestrial Systems – https://www.nhm.ac.uk/our-science/our-work/biodiversity/predicts.html). We make site-level summary data available alongside this article. The full database will be publicly available in 2015.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",5,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Hudson","given":"Lawrence N."},{"family":"Newbold","given":"Tim"},{"family":"Contu","given":"Sara"},{"family":"Hill","given":"Samantha L.

Post-incisive chronosequences are the most common type of chronosequence. They are found in many landscapes, including sand dunes, glacial moraines, landslide scars, old pasture, burnt landscape patches, old mining areas, lava flows, alluvial fans, floodplains, river terraces, and marine terraces. They register pedogenic change over time-scales ranging from years to millions of years. Soil chronosequences help in testing rival theories of pedogenesis. Traditional soil formation theory sees a soil developing progressively under the influence of the environmental state factors until it is in equilibrium with prevailing environmental conditions. This developmental view of pedogenesis is supported by the classic soil chronosequence studies. A new evolutionary view of pedogenesis, which was prompted by the omnipresent inconstancy of environmental conditions and the notions of multidirectional changes and multiple steady states (as predicted by non-linear dynamics), proposes that environmental inconstancy and non-linear behaviour in soil-landscapes lead to soil evolution, rather than to soil development. Soils `evolve' through continual creation and destruction at all scales, and may progress, stay the same, or retrogress, depending on the environmental circumstances. Some recent soil and vegetation chronosequence investigations support an evolutionary view of pedogenesis. It is concluded that soil chronosequences are still potent instruments for pedological investigations and that they have a starring role to play in the testing of pedological theories.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",3,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Huggett","given":"R.

About 80% of Earth’s terrestrial surface remains roadless, but this area is fragmented into ~600,000 patches, more than half of which are <1 square kilometer and only 7% of which are larger than 100 square kilometers.

This is essential for us to be able to predict, and eventually mitigate, the consequences of increasing environmental perturbations such as habitat loss, climate change, and invasions of exotic species. 2 Ecological networks can be subdivided into three broad types: ‘traditional’ food webs, mutualistic networks and host–parasitoid networks. There is a recent trend towards cross-comparisons among network types and also to take a more mechanistic, as opposed to phenomenological, perspective. For example, analysis of network configurations, such as compartments, allows us to explore the role of co-evolution in structuring mutualistic networks and host–parasitoid networks, and of body size in food webs. 3 Research into ecological networks has recently undergone a renaissance, leading to the production of a new catalogue of evermore complete, taxonomically resolved, and quantitative data. Novel topological patterns have been unearthed and it is increasingly evident that it is the distribution of interaction strengths and the configuration of complexity, rather than just its magnitude, that governs network stability and structure. 4 Another significant advance is the growing recognition of the importance of individual traits and behaviour: interactions, after all, occur between individuals. The new generation of high-quality networks is now enabling us to move away from describing networks based on species-averaged data and to start exploring patterns based on individuals. Such refinements will enable us to address more general ecological questions relating to foraging theory and the recent metabolic theory of ecology. 5 We conclude by suggesting a number of ‘dead ends’ and ‘fruitful avenues’ for future research into ecological networks.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",4,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Ings","given":"Thomas C."},{"family":"Montoya","given":"José M."},{"family":"Bascompte","given":"Jordi"},{"family":"Blüthgen","given":"Nico"},{"family":"Brown","given":"Lee"},{"family":"Dormann","given":"Carsten F."},{"family":"Edwards","given":"François"},{"family":"Figueroa","given":"David"},{"family":"Jacob","given":"Ute"},{"family":"Jones","given":"J.

As a result, the response of many taxonomic groups to forest management is much less documented. With the advent of low-cost next generation barcoding approaches, it is now possible to envisage monitoring strategies based on molecular approaches, beyond metabarcoding/eDNA strategies that do not give access to species abundances and integrate species presence over largely unknown spatio-temporal scales. In this contribution, we demonstrate the use of massive DNA barcoding – also referred as megabarcoding – as a promising solution to overcome identification difficulties in demanding taxonomic groups. We performed a proof of concept study in a mountainous beech forest in the Massif Central, France. We sampled soil macrofauna at 25 sampling sites and managed to visually identify at the species level 130 out of the 1413 sampled individuals. Using megabarcoding on the 1283 remaining non-identified individuals, we managed to assign 1124 additional individuals to an operational taxonomic species at a competitive cost. We present the summary statistics of barcoding success in the different taxonomic groups encountered and in larvae versus adult individuals. We demonstrate that larvae individuals, which can hardly be visually identified at the species level, make a substantial contribution to overall macrofauna diversity. We finally showcase how this megabarcoding approach provides a concrete avenue for forest biodiversity monitoring, by assessing the cost and labour intensity of this approach.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",4,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Jabot","given":"Franck"},{"family":"Auger","given":"Gwenaëlle"},{"family":"Bonnal","given":"Pauline"},{"family":"Pizaine","given":"Mathilde"},{"family":"Roncoroni","given":"Marilyn"},{"family":"Revaillot","given":"Sandrine"},{"family":"Pottier","given":"Julien"}],"citation-key":"Jabot2025_Usemassive","DOI":"10.1101/2025.02.07.636998","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,8]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2025, Posted by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.

Most studies, however, have focused only on the incidence of species, and have not considered changes in local abundance. Here we asked whether analysing changes in the cover of plant species could reveal previously unrecognized patterns of biodiversity change and provide insights into the underlying mechanisms. We compiled and analysed a dataset of 7,738 permanent and semi-permanent vegetation plots from Germany that were surveyed between 2 and 54 times from 1927 to 2020, in total comprising 1,794 species of vascular plants. We found that decrements in cover, averaged across all species and plots, occurred more often than increments; that the number of species that decreased in cover was higher than the number of species that increased; and that decrements were more equally distributed among losers than were gains among winners. Null model simulations confirmed that these trends do not emerge by chance, but are the consequence of species-specific negative effects of environmental changes. In the long run, these trends might result in substantial losses of species at both local and regional scales. Summarizing the changes by decade shows that the inequality in the mean change in species cover of losers and winners diverged as early as the 1960s. We conclude that changes in species cover in communities represent an important but understudied dimension of biodiversity change that should more routinely be considered in time-series analyses.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",4,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Jandt","given":"Ute"},{"family":"Bruelheide","given":"Helge"},{"family":"Jansen","given":"Florian"},{"family":"Bonn","given":"Aletta"},{"family":"Grescho","given":"Volker"},{"family":"Klenke","given":"Reinhard A."},{"family":"Sabatini","given":"Francesco Maria"},{"family":"Bernhardt-Römermann","given":"Markus"},{"family":"Blüml","given":"Volker"},{"family":"Dengler","given":"Jürgen"},{"family":"Diekmann","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Doerfler","given":"Inken"},{"family":"Döring","given":"Ute"},{"family":"Dullinger","given":"Stefan"},{"family":"Haider","given":"Sylvia"},{"family":"Heinken","given":"Thilo"},{"family":"Horchler","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Kuhn","given":"Gisbert"},{"family":"Lindner","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Metze","given":"Katrin"},{"family":"Müller","given":"Norbert"},{"family":"Naaf","given":"Tobias"},{"family":"Peppler-Lisbach","given":"Cord"},{"family":"Poschlod","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Roscher","given":"Christiane"},{"family":"Rosenthal","given":"Gert"},{"family":"Rumpf","given":"Sabine B."},{"family":"Schmidt","given":"Wolfgang"},{"family":"Schrautzer","given":"Joachim"},{"family":"Schwabe","given":"Angelika"},{"family":"Schwartze","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Sperle","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Stanik","given":"Nils"},{"family":"Storm","given":"Christian"},{"family":"Voigt","given":"Winfried"},{"family":"Wegener","given":"Uwe"},{"family":"Wesche","given":"Karsten"},{"family":"Wittig","given":"Burghard"},{"family":"Wulf","given":"Monika"}],"citation-key":"Jandt2022_Morelosses","container-title":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/s41586-022-05320-w","ISSN":"1476-4687","issue":"7936","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",11]]},"language":"en","license":"2022 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited","page":"512-518","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"More losses than gains during one century of plant biodiversity change in Germany","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05320-w","volume":"611"},{"id":"Jeanneret2014_expertsystem","abstract":"Decision-making for nature-friendly land use in farming landscapes requires methods and indicators for assessing effects on biodiversity. We developed an expert system for including biodiversity (i.e., organismal diversity) as a life-cycle assessment (LCA) impact category in agricultural production. The method developed is valid for grasslands, arable crops and semi-natural habitats (SNHs) of the farming landscape, and allows us to estimate the impact of management systems on biodiversity. Eleven indicator-species groups or ISGs (flora of crops and grasslands, birds, mammals, amphibians, snails, spiders, carabids, butterflies, wild bees, and grasshoppers) were selected on the basis of ecological and life-cycle assessment criteria. Inventory data on crops, SNHs and agricultural practices with detailed management options were specified. A scoring system estimating the suitability of the farmland crops and SNHs as habitats as well as the reaction of each indicator-species group to the management options was developed. A case study calculated biodiversity scores for grassland along an intensity gradient, as well as those for winter wheat in the case of various cropping systems. The results allowed us to identify management options expected to have a major impact on biodiversity. The number of species observed during a plant and grasshopper survey showed high correlations with the scores derived from the detailed management activities. The use of 11 indicator-species groups allowed a differential, comparatively comprehensive assessment of the impacts of the agricultural practices on biodiversity. Production systems can be compared in terms of their potential impact on biodiversity, which may in turn enable us to make recommendations for good practice. We conclude that the expert system can also be used to investigate land-use scenarios at farm level, as well as on a regional scale.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",4,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Jeanneret","given":"Philippe"},{"family":"Baumgartner","given":"Daniel U."},{"family":"Freiermuth Knuchel","given":"Ruth"},{"family":"Koch","given":"Bärbel"},{"family":"Gaillard","given":"Gérard"}],"citation-key":"Jeanneret2014_expertsystem","container-title":"Ecological Indicators","container-title-short":"Ecological Indicators","DOI":"10.1016/j.ecolind.2014.06.030","ISSN":"1470-160X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",11,1]]},"page":"224-231","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"An expert system for integrating biodiversity into agricultural life-cycle assessment","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1470160X14002830","volume":"46"},{"id":"Jeffery2010_Europeanatlas","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",3,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Jeffery","given":"Simon"},{"family":"Gardi","given":"Ciro"},{"family":"Jones","given":"Arwyn"},{"family":"Montanarella","given":"Luca"},{"family":"Marmo","given":"Luca"},{"family":"Miko","given":"Ladislav"},{"family":"Pérès","given":"Guénola"},{"family":"Römbke","given":"Jörg"},{"family":"Putten","given":"Wim H.","non-dropping-particle":"van der"}],"citation-key":"Jeffery2010_Europeanatlas","event-place":"LU","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010"]]},"language":"en","note":"ISBN 978-92-79-15806-3","publisher":"Publications Office of the European Union","publisher-place":"LU","source":"DOI.org (CSL JSON)","title":"European atlas of soil biodiversity.","type":"report","URL":"https://data.europa.eu/doi/10.2788/94222"},{"id":"Jenny1994_Factorssoil","abstract":"The vast importance of the soil in the development of various\nsystems of agriculture and types of civilizations has long been\nrecognized; but it is only within the last few decades that soils as such\nhave been studied in a scientific manner.

The inherent heterogeneity and sparseness of raw biodiversity data are overcome by the use of models and remotely sensed covariates to inform predictions that are contiguous in space and time and global in extent. We define the species population EBVs as a space–time–species–gram (cube) that simultaneously addresses the distribution or abundance of multiple species, with its resolution adjusted to represent available evidence and acceptable levels of uncertainty. This essential information enables the monitoring of single or aggregate spatial or taxonomic units at scales relevant to research and decision-making. When combined with ancillary environmental or species data, this fundamental species population information directly underpins a range of biodiversity and ecosystem function indicators. The unified concept we present links disparate data to downstream uses and informs a vision for species population monitoring in which data collection is closely integrated with models and infrastructure to support effective biodiversity assessment.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Jetz","given":"Walter"},{"family":"McGeoch","given":"Melodie A."},{"family":"Guralnick","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Ferrier","given":"Simon"},{"family":"Beck","given":"Jan"},{"family":"Costello","given":"Mark J."},{"family":"Fernandez","given":"Miguel"},{"family":"Geller","given":"Gary N."},{"family":"Keil","given":"Petr"},{"family":"Merow","given":"Cory"},{"family":"Meyer","given":"Carsten"},{"family":"Muller-Karger","given":"Frank E."},{"family":"Pereira","given":"Henrique M."},{"family":"Regan","given":"Eugenie C."},{"family":"Schmeller","given":"Dirk S."},{"family":"Turak","given":"Eren"}],"citation-key":"Jetz2019_EssentialBiodiversity","container-title":"Nature Ecology & Evolution","container-title-short":"Nat Ecol Evol","DOI":"10.1038/s41559-019-0826-1","ISSN":"2397-334X","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",4]]},"language":"en","license":"2019 The Author(s)","number":"4","page":"539-551","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Essential biodiversity variables for mapping and monitoring species populations","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-019-0826-1","volume":"3"},{"id":"Jones2021_TaxonomicIdentification","abstract":"High-throughput sequencing 16S rRNA gene surveys have enabled new insights into the diversity of soil bacteria, and furthered understanding of the ecological drivers of abundances across landscapes. However, current analytical approaches are of limited use in formalizing syntheses of the ecological attributes of taxa discovered, because derived taxonomic units are typically unique to individual studies and sequence identification databases only characterize taxonomy. To address this, we used sequences obtained from a large nationwide soil survey (GB Countryside Survey, henceforth CS) to create a comprehensive soil specific 16S reference database, with coupled ecological information derived from survey metadata. Specifically, we modeled taxon responses to soil pH at the OTU level using hierarchical logistic regression (HOF) models, to provide information on both the shape of landscape scale pH-abundance responses, and pH optima (pH at which OTU abundance is maximal). We identify that most of the soil OTUs examined exhibited a non-flat relationship with soil pH. Further, the pH optima could not be generalized by broad taxonomy, highlighting the need for tools and databases synthesizing ecological traits at finer taxonomic resolution. We further demonstrate the utility of the database by testing against geographically dispersed query 16S datasets; evaluating efficacy by quantifying matches, and accuracy in predicting pH responses of query sequences from a separate large soil survey. We found that the CS database provided good coverage of dominant taxa; and that the taxa indicating soil pH in a query dataset corresponded with the pH classifications of top matches in the CS database. Furthermore we were able to predict query dataset community structure, using predicted abundances of dominant taxa based on query soil pH data and the HOF models of matched CS database taxa. The database with associated HOF model outputs is released as an online portal for querying single sequences of interest (https://shiny-apps.ceh.ac.uk/ID-TaxER/), and flat files are made available for use in bioinformatic pipelines. The further development of advanced informatics infrastructures incorporating modeled ecological attributes along with new functional genomic information will likely facilitate large scale exploration and prediction of soil microbial functional biodiversity under current and future environmental change scenarios.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",4,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Jones","given":"Briony"},{"family":"Goodall","given":"Tim"},{"family":"George","given":"Paul B.

Compared to aquatic algae, the literature on subaerial algae is minimal, including studies of distinctive habitats such as forest soils, agricultural fields, deserts, polar regions, specific subaerial zones, artificial structures, and tropical soils. The primary goal here was to identify the gaps and scope of research on such algae. Accordingly, the literature was analyzed per sub-themes, such as the “nature of current research data on terrestrial algae,” “methodological approaches,” “diversity,” “environmental relationships,” “ecological roles,” and “economic significance.” The review showed there is a high diversity of algae in soils, especially members belonging to the Cyanophyta (Cyanobacteria) and Chlorophyta. Algal distributions in terrestrial environments depend on the microhabitat conditions, and many species of soil algae are sensitive to specific soil conditions. The ecological significance of soil algae includes primary production, the release of biochemical stimulants and plant growth promoters into soils, nitrogen fixation, solubilization of minerals, and the enhancement and maintenance of soil fertility. Since aero-terrestrial habitats are generally stressed environments, algae of such environments can be rich in rare metabolites and natural products. For example, epilithic soil algae use wet adhesive molecules to fix them firmly on the substratum. Exploring the ecological roles and economic utility of soil and other subaerial algae could be helpful for the development of algae-based industries and for achieving sustainable soil management.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Joseph","given":"Jebin"},{"family":"Ray","given":"Joseph George"}],"citation-key":"Joseph2024_CriticalReview","container-title":"Journal of Phycology","DOI":"10.1111/jpy.13444","ISSN":"1529-8817","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2024 Phycological Society of America.","number":"2","page":"229-253","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"A critical review of soil algae as a crucial soil biological component of high ecological and economic significance","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jpy.13444","volume":"60"},{"id":"Jung2020_globalmap","abstract":"We provide a global, spatially explicit characterization of 47 terrestrial habitat types, as defined in the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) habitat classification scheme, which is widely used in ecological analyses, including for quantifying species’ Area of Habitat.

To meet these goals we recommend the following steps to be taken by the soil science community as a whole: (i) embrace the UN SDGs, as they provide a platform that allows soil science to demonstrate its relevance for realizing a sustainable society by 2030; (ii) show the specific value of soil science: research should explicitly show how using modern soil information can improve the results of inter- and transdisciplinary studies on SDGs related to food security, water scarcity, climate change, biodiversity loss and health threats; (iii) take leadership in overarching system analysis of ecosystems, as soils and soil scientists have an integrated nature and this places soil scientists in a unique position; (iii) raise awareness of soil organic matter as a key attribute of soils to illustrate its importance for soil functions and ecosystem services; (iv) improve the transfer of knowledge through knowledge brokers with a soil background; (v) start at the basis: educational programmes are needed at all levels, starting in primary schools, and emphasizing practical, down-to-earth examples; (vi) facilitate communication with the policy arena by framing research in terms that resonate with politicians in terms of the policy cycle or by considering drivers, pressures and responses affecting impacts of land use change; and finally (vii) all this is only possible if researchers, with soil scientists in the front lines, look over the hedge towards other disciplines, to the world at large and to the policy arena, reaching over to listen first, as a basis for genuine collaboration.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Keesstra","given":"Saskia D."},{"family":"Bouma","given":"Johan"},{"family":"Wallinga","given":"Jakob"},{"family":"Tittonell","given":"Pablo"},{"family":"Smith","given":"Pete"},{"family":"Cerdà","given":"Artemi"},{"family":"Montanarella","given":"Luca"},{"family":"Quinton","given":"John N."},{"family":"Pachepsky","given":"Yakov"},{"family":"van der Putten","given":"Wim H."},{"family":"Bardgett","given":"Richard D."},{"family":"Moolenaar","given":"Simon"},{"family":"Mol","given":"Gerben"},{"family":"Jansen","given":"Boris"},{"family":"Fresco","given":"Louise O."}],"citation-key":"Keesstra2016_significancesoils","container-title":"SOIL","container-title-short":"SOIL","DOI":"10.5194/soil-2-111-2016","ISSN":"2199-398X","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",4,7]]},"language":"en","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"2","page":"111-128","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The significance of soils and soil science towards realization of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://soil.copernicus.org/articles/2/111/2016/","volume":"2"},{"id":"Keith2020_IUCNGlobal","abstract":"Ecosystems are critically important components of&nbsp;Earth’s biological diversity and as the natural capital that sustains human life and well-being.

The major challenge within sustainable soil management is to conserve ecosystem service delivery while optimizing agricultural yields. It is proposed that soil health is dependent on the maintenance of four major functions: carbon transformations; nutrient cycles; soil structure maintenance; and the regulation of pests and diseases. Each of these functions is manifested as an aggregate of a variety of biological processes provided by a diversity of interacting soil organisms under the influence of the abiotic soil environment. Analysis of current models of the soil community under the impact of agricultural interventions (particularly those entailing substitution of biological processes with fossil fuel-derived energy or inputs) confirms the highly integrative pattern of interactions within each of these functions and leads to the conclusion that measurement of individual groups of organisms, processes or soil properties does not suffice to indicate the state of the soil health. A further conclusion is that quantifying the flow of energy and carbon between functions is an essential but non-trivial task for the assessment and management of soil health.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",4,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Kibblewhite","given":"M.g"},{"family":"Ritz","given":"K"},{"family":"Swift","given":"M.j"}],"citation-key":"Kibblewhite2007_Soilhealth","container-title":"Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","DOI":"10.1098/rstb.2007.2178","issue":"1492","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",9,4]]},"page":"685-701","publisher":"Royal Society","source":"royalsocietypublishing.org (Atypon)","title":"Soil health in agricultural systems","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2007.2178","volume":"363"},{"id":"Kier2001_Measuringmapping","abstract":"The adjustment of an existing index which combines endemism and species richness (Williams 1993) is proposed so that it requires markedly less data on the study area and its flora or fauna than was necessary with the conventional calculation method. Using this adjusted method, the resulting scores are calculated and mapped for the seed plant flora of the 20 African regions as delineated by White (1983). We argue that this index, here referred to as a measure of ‘endemism richness’, can be regarded as the specific contribution of an area to global biodiversity. We demonstrate that at a given sampling scale it shows a linear relation with area. We further demonstrate that, within certain limits, this linearity can also be observed in many cases when sampling scales vary which makes the comparison of differently sized geographic units easier than is the case for species richness. The two most important advantages over species richness are that this index is more suitable to measure both the conservation value of an area and the negative impact of invaders. The latter quality is due to the fact that it yields scores which usually do not rise substantially but can rather be expected to drop in many cases when an area is invaded by alien species.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",4,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Kier","given":"Gerold"},{"family":"Barthlott","given":"Wilhelm"}],"citation-key":"Kier2001_Measuringmapping","container-title":"Biodiversity & Conservation","container-title-short":"Biodiversity and Conservation","DOI":"10.1023/A:1011812528849","ISSN":"1572-9710","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2001",9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1513-1529","source":"Springer Link","title":"Measuring and mapping endemism and species richness: a new methodological approach and its application on the flora of Africa","title-short":"Measuring and mapping endemism and species richness","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1011812528849","volume":"10"},{"id":"Kier2005_Globalpatterns","abstract":"Aims We present the first global map of vascular plant species richness by ecoregion and compare these results with the published literature on global priorities for plant conservation. In so doing, we assess the state of floristic knowledge across ecoregions as described in floras, checklists, and other published documents and pinpoint geographical gaps in our understanding of the global vascular plant flora. Finally, we explore the relationships between plant species richness by ecoregion and our knowledge of the flora, and between plant richness and the human footprint – a spatially explicit measure of the loss and degradation of natural habitats and ecosystems as a result of human activities. Location Global. Methods Richness estimates for the 867 terrestrial ecoregions of the world were derived from published richness data of c. 1800 geographical units. We applied one of four methods to assess richness, depending on data quality. These included collation and interpretation of published data, use of species–area curves to extrapolate richness, use of taxon-based data, and estimates derived from other ecoregions within the same biome. Results The highest estimate of plant species richness is in the Borneo lowlands ecoregion (10,000 species) followed by nine ecoregions located in Central and South America with ≥ 8000 species; all are found within the Tropical and Subtropical Moist Broadleaf Forests biome. Among the 51 ecoregions with ≥ 5000 species, only five are located in temperate regions. For 43% of the 867 ecoregions, data quality was considered good or moderate. Among biomes, adequate data are especially lacking for flooded grasslands and flooded savannas. We found a significant correlation between species richness and data quality for only a few biomes, and, in all of these cases, our results indicated that species-rich ecoregions are better studied than those poor in vascular plants. Similarly, only in a few biomes did we find significant correlations between species richness and the human footprint, all of which were positive. Main conclusions The work presented here sets the stage for comparisons of degree of concordance of plant species richness with plant endemism and vertebrate species richness: important analyses for a comprehensive global biodiversity strategy. We suggest: (1) that current global plant conservation strategies be reviewed to check if they cover the most outstanding examples of regions from each of the world's major biomes, even if these examples are species-poor compared with other biomes; (2) that flooded grasslands and flooded savannas should become a global priority in collecting and compiling richness data for vascular plants; and (3) that future studies which rely upon species–area calculations do not use a uniform parameter value but instead use values derived separately for subregions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",4,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Kier","given":"Gerold"},{"family":"Mutke","given":"Jens"},{"family":"Dinerstein","given":"Eric"},{"family":"Ricketts","given":"Taylor H."},{"family":"Küper","given":"Wolfgang"},{"family":"Kreft","given":"Holger"},{"family":"Barthlott","given":"Wilhelm"}],"citation-key":"Kier2005_Globalpatterns","container-title":"Journal of Biogeography","DOI":"10.1111/j.1365-2699.2005.01272.x","ISSN":"1365-2699","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005"]]},"language":"en","page":"1107-1116","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Global patterns of plant diversity and floristic knowledge","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2699.2005.01272.x","volume":"32"},{"id":"Kirse2021_UnearthingPotential","abstract":"Metabarcoding has proven to be a powerful tool to assess ecological patterns and diversity from different habitats. Terrestrial invertebrate diversity is frequently based on bulk samples, which require comparatively high sampling effort. With environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding, field sampling effort can be reduced while increasing the number of recovered organism groups. However, a proof of concept is missing for several invertebrate groups, hampering the development of best-practice advice for these groups. This study aims to provide recommendations on key aspects for the processing of soil samples, from sampling effort to choice of DNA extraction method and marker genes. This study uses eDNA metabarcoding as a tool for assessing invertebrate biodiversity in soil samples, specifically comparing two DNA extraction methods (with and without a lysis step) and two genes, 18S and COI markers. The results show that the choice of marker and DNA extraction method (including a lysis step) significantly affect species detection rates and concomitantly observed invertebrate community composition. Combining methods, by using larger amounts of starting material and including a lysis step resulted in an increase of invertebrate species numbers. Together, these methods improved the detection of species with known lower population densities and allowed the assessment of temporary mesofauna. Furthermore, the choice of marker significantly influenced the diversity levels found. The 18S marker allowed the detection of a higher number of annelid and nematode OTUs, while the COI marker was more suitable for detecting changes in arthropod community structure, especially at the species level. This study makes significant advances to the field of invertebrate biodiversity assessment, particularly using metabarcoding tools by addressing several methodological considerations that are key for accurate ecological appraisals.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",4,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Kirse","given":"Ameli"},{"family":"Bourlat","given":"Sarah J."},{"family":"Langen","given":"Kathrin"},{"family":"Fonseca","given":"Vera G."}],"citation-key":"Kirse2021_UnearthingPotential","container-title":"Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution","container-title-short":"Front.

The island biogeography paradigm therefore needs refining to account for specific responses of taxa to the area of habitat “islands” and to the quality of the surrounding matrix. We incorporated matrix effects into island theory by partitioning the slope (z value) of species–area relationships into two components: γ, a constant, and σ, a measure of taxon-specific responses to each component of a heterogeneous matrix. We used our matrix-calibrated model to predict extinction and endangerment of bird species resulting from land-use change in 20 biodiversity hotspots and compared these predictions with observed numbers of extinct and threatened bird species. We repeated this analysis with the conventional species–area model and the countryside species–area model, considering alternative z values of 0.35 (island) or 0.22 (continental). We evaluated the relative strength of support for each of the five candidate models with Akaike's information criterion (AIC). The matrix-calibrated model had the highest AIC weight (wi = 89.21%), which means the weight of evidence in support of this model was the optimal model given the set of candidate models and the data. In addition to being a valuable heuristic tool for assessing extinction risk, our matrix-calibrated model also allows quantitative assessment of biodiversity benefits (and trade-offs) of land-management options in human-dominated landscapes. Given that processes of secondary regeneration have become more widespread across tropical regions and are predicted to increase, our matrix-calibrated model will be increasingly appropriate for practical conservation in tropical landscapes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Koh","given":"Lian Pin"},{"family":"Ghazoul","given":"Jaboury"}],"citation-key":"Koh2010_MatrixCalibratedSpeciesArea","container-title":"Conservation Biology","DOI":"10.1111/j.1523-1739.2010.01464.x","ISSN":"1523-1739","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010"]]},"language":"en","license":"©2010 Society for Conservation Biology","number":"4","page":"994-1001","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"A Matrix-Calibrated Species-Area Model for Predicting Biodiversity Losses Due to Land-Use Change","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2010.01464.x","volume":"24"},{"id":"Kuipers2019_PotentialConsequences","abstract":"Because the biosphere is highly heterogeneous, species diversity impacts are typically assessed at local or regional scales.

This requires a conversion (or weighting) factor that takes into account the characteristics of regionally specific species compositions. We developed a methodology for deriving such conversion factors based on species’ habitat ranges, International Union for Conservation of Nature threat levels, and species richness. We call these conversion factors global extinction probabilities (GEPs) of the reference location or region. The proposed methodology allows for the calculation of GEPs for any spatial unit and species group for which data on spatial distribution are available and can be implemented in methodologies like life cycle impact assessment. Furthermore, the GEPs can be used for the identification of conservation hot spots. The results of the proposed GEPs (for various taxonomic groups) show that the risk that regional species loss may result in global species extinctions significantly differs per region and informs where irreversible biodiversity impacts are more likely to occur.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Kuipers","given":"Koen J.

We find a significant positive but uncertain relationship between MSA loss and PDF. Based on the empirical data, PDF leaves about half of the variance in MSA loss unexplained. Our results further highlight that MSA loss and PDF reveal distinct aspects of community change. At a PDF of zero, we find an average decline in MSA of 0.20 (95% CI = 0.09–0.42), reflecting that abundance loss precedes species extinction and that MSA loss is a more sensitive indicator of biodiversity change than PDF, particularly at low PDF values. Given the intrinsic differences between the indicators and the large residual heterogeneity in the relationship between them, we conclude that MSA loss and PDF provide complementary information.

Soil degradation, characterized by decline in quality and decrease in ecosystem goods and services, is a major constraint to achieving the required increase in agricultural production. Soil is a non-renewable resource on human time scales with its vulnerability to degradation depending on complex interactions between processes, factors and causes occurring at a range of spatial and temporal scales. Among the major soil degradation processes are accelerated erosion, depletion of the soil organic carbon (SOC) pool and loss in biodiversity, loss of soil fertility and elemental imbalance, acidification and salinization. Soil degradation trends can be reversed by conversion to a restorative land use and adoption of recommended management practices. The strategy is to minimize soil erosion, create positive SOC and N budgets, enhance activity and species diversity of soil biota (micro, meso, and macro), and improve structural stability and pore geometry. Improving soil quality (i.e., increasing SOC pool, improving soil structure, enhancing soil fertility) can reduce risks of soil degradation (physical, chemical, biological and ecological) while improving the environment. Increasing the SOC pool to above the critical level (10 to 15 g/kg) is essential to set-in-motion the restorative trends. Site-specific techniques of restoring soil quality include conservation agriculture, integrated nutrient management, continuous vegetative cover such as residue mulch and cover cropping, and controlled grazing at appropriate stocking rates. The strategy is to produce “more from less” by reducing losses and increasing soil, water, and nutrient use efficiency.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Lal","given":"Rattan"}],"citation-key":"Lal2015_RestoringSoil","container-title":"Sustainability","DOI":"10.3390/su7055875","ISSN":"2071-1050","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",5]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"5","page":"5875-5895","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"Restoring Soil Quality to Mitigate Soil Degradation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/7/5/5875","volume":"7"},{"id":"Larrey-Lassalle2018_Developingcharacterisation","abstract":"Habitat change was identified by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment as the main direct driver of biodiversity loss.

This paper presents a practical approach to constructing a biodiversity knowledge graph from heterogeneous and distributed (semi-)structured data sources.

These obstacles include: (1) most data on the trophic interactions and feeding behaviour of soil organisms being scattered across disparate repositories, without well-established standard for describing and structuring trophic datasets; (2) the existence of various competing terms, rather than consensus, to delineate feeding-related concepts such as diets, trophic groups, feeding processes, resource types, leading to ambiguities that hinder meaningful data integration from different studies; (3) considerable divergence in the trophic classification of numerous soil organisms, or even the lack of such classifications, leading to discrepancies in the resolution of reconstructed food webs and complicating the reuse and comparison of food-web models within synthetic studies. To address these issues, we introduce the Soil Food Web Ontology, a novel formal conceptual framework designed to foster agreement on the trophic ecology of soil organisms. This ontology represents a collaborative and ongoing endeavour aimed at establishing consensus and formal definitions for the array of concepts relevant to soil trophic ecology. Its primary objective is to enhance the accessibility, interpretation, combination, reuse, and automated processing of trophic data. By harmonising the terminology and fundamental principles of soil trophic ecology, we anticipate that the Soil Food Web Ontology will improve knowledge management within the field. It will help soil ecologists to better harness existing information regarding the feeding behaviours of soil organisms, facilitate more robust trophic classifications, streamline the reconstruction of soil food webs, and ultimately render food-web research more inclusive, reusable and reproducible.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",5,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Le Guillarme","given":"Nicolas"},{"family":"Hedde","given":"Mickael"},{"family":"Potapov","given":"Anton M."},{"family":"Martínez-Muñoz","given":"Carlos A."},{"family":"Berg","given":"Matty P."},{"family":"Briones","given":"Maria J.

The impact assessment method presented in this article allows the quantification of the impact of land-using production processes on biodiversity for several broad land use classes. It provides a calculation framework with degrees of customisation (e.g., to take into account regional conservation priorities), but also offers a default valuation of biodiversity based on naturalness.

An overview of the virtual CO2 emissions and virtual water flow trends in the international trade based on consumption perspective is performed in the current work. The review of the recent literature indicates that: (1) Producers and consumers are located at various places in different parts of the world, and consequently they are significant differences in virtual GHG (Greenhouse gases) emissions. (2) The US and the EU have high absolute net CO2 imports. (3) China and some other fast developing countries as India, Brazil, and others are exporting countries and increasingly carry the load of exports of virtual GHG including CO2 emissions and virtual water that are triggered due to consumption of the related goods in the importing countries. (4) By importing products produced with lower carbon emission intensity and less water consumption than in the domestic industry, international trade can reduce global environmental pressure.

Soil quality is fundamental to the sustainability of the planet, as it also affects other natural resources. Therefore, it must be seen as a fundamental action for the sustainability of the planet and be evaluated using methodologies capable of holistically relating the environmental impacts of production systems, as does the Life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology. However, due to the lack of suitable models, LCA is still ineffective in assessing soil quality. Therefore, our objective was to evaluate the use of chemical soil quality indicators in the context of LCA, contributing new information to the debate. To this end, a set of soil quality indicators from the APOIA-NovoRural method were applied in some agricultural production systems in southern Brazil. Thus, the LCA results confirmed soil quality maintenance activities as those that most contribute to impacts, particularly in the categories of climate change, (eco)toxicities and land use. However, the indicators efficiently contributed direct information about the agricultural environment, relating them to the impacts estimated by the LCA. Therefore, the use of indicators makes it possible to improve soil management by adjusting chemical parameters, accurately contextualizing activities, and use of inputs to the real conditions of the area assessed. Thus, we demonstrate that indicators can be useful in providing information for agricultural environmental management in interrelation with LCA, whose application alone is not yet capable of achieving such results.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Lucas","given":"K.

Here we create a database of root-mass fractions (RMFs), an index of plant below- versus aboveground biomass distributions, and generate quantitative, spatially explicit global maps of RMFs in trees, shrubs and grasses. Our analyses reveal large gradients in RMFs both across and within vegetation types that can be attributed to resource availability. High RMFs occur in cold and dry ecosystems, while low RMFs dominate in warm and wet regions. Across all vegetation types, the directional effect of temperature on RMFs depends on water availability, suggesting feedbacks between heat, water and nutrient supply. By integrating our RMF maps with existing aboveground plant biomass information, we estimate that in forests, shrublands and grasslands, respectively, 22%, 47% and 67% of plant biomass exists belowground, with a total global belowground fraction of 24% (20–28%), that is, 113 (90–135) Gt carbon. By documenting the environmental correlates of root biomass allocation, our results can inform model projections of global vegetation dynamics under current and future climate scenarios.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",3,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Ma","given":"Haozhi"},{"family":"Mo","given":"Lidong"},{"family":"Crowther","given":"Thomas W."},{"family":"Maynard","given":"Daniel S."},{"family":"Hoogen","given":"Johan","non-dropping-particle":"van den"},{"family":"Stocker","given":"Benjamin D."},{"family":"Terrer","given":"César"},{"family":"Zohner","given":"Constantin M."}],"citation-key":"Ma2021_GlobalDistribution","container-title":"Nature Ecology & Evolution","container-title-short":"Nat Ecol Evol","DOI":"10.1038/s41559-021-01485-1","ISSN":"2397-334X","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",8]]},"language":"en","license":"2021 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited","number":"8","page":"1110-1122","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"The global distribution and environmental drivers of aboveground versus belowground plant biomass","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-021-01485-1","volume":"5"},{"id":"MacArthur2001_theoryisland","author":[{"family":"MacArthur","given":"Robert H."},{"family":"Wilson","given":"Edward O."}],"call-number":"QH85 .M3 2001","citation-key":"MacArthur2001_theoryisland","event-place":"Princeton","ISBN":"978-0-691-08836-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2001"]]},"number-of-pages":"203","publisher":"Princeton University Press","publisher-place":"Princeton","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"The theory of island biogeography","type":"book","URL":"https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691088365/the-theory-of-island-biogeography"},{"id":"Mace2014_Approachesdefining","abstract":"The idea that there is an identiﬁable set of boundaries, beyond which anthropogenic change will put the Earth system outside a safe operating space for humanity, is attracting interest in the scientiﬁc community and gaining support in the environmental policy world. Rockstrom et al. (2009) identify nine such boundaries and highlight biodiversity loss as being the single boundary where current rates of extinction put the Earth system furthest outside the safe operating space. Here we review the evidence to support a boundary based on extinction rates and identify weaknesses with this metric and its bearing on humanity’s needs. While changes to biodiversity are of undisputed importance, we show that both extinction rate and species richness are weak metrics for this purpose, and they do not scale well from local to regional or global levels. We develop alternative approaches to determine biodiversity loss boundaries and extend our analysis to consider large-scale responses in the Earth system that could affect its suitability for complex human societies which in turn are mediated by the biosphere. We suggest three facets of biodiversity on which a boundary could be based: the genetic library of life; functional type diversity; and biome condition and extent. For each of these we explore the science needed to indicate how it might be measured and how changes would affect human societies. In addition to these three facets, we show how biodiversity’s role in supporting a safe operating space for humanity may lie primarily in its interactions with other boundaries, suggesting an immediate area of focus for scientists and policymakers.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",4,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Mace","given":"Georgina M."},{"family":"Reyers","given":"Belinda"},{"family":"Alkemade","given":"Rob"},{"family":"Biggs","given":"Reinette"},{"family":"Chapin","given":"F.

The first step in addressing the challenge of how to reverse the negative outlook for the coming years starts with measuring environmental loss rates and assigning responsibilities. Pinpointing the global pressures on biodiversity is a task best addressed using holistic models such as Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). LCA is the leading method for calculating cradle-to-grave environmental impacts of products and services; it is actively promoted by many public policies, and integrated as part of environmental information systems within private companies. LCA already deals with the potential biodiversity impacts of land use, but there are significant obstacles to overcome before its models grasp the full reach of the phenomena involved. In this review, we discuss some pressing issues that need to be addressed. LCA mainly introduces biodiversity as an endpoint category modeled as a loss in species richness due to the conversion and use of land over time and space. The functional and population effects on biodiversity are mostly absent due to the emphasis on species accumulation with limited geographic and taxonomical reach. Current land-use modeling activities that use biodiversity indicators tend to oversimplify the real dynamics and complexity of the interactions of species among each other and with their habitats. To identify the main areas for improvement, we systematically reviewed LCA studies on land use that had findings related to global change and conservation ecology. We provide suggestion as to how to address some of the issues raised. Our overall objective was to encourage companies to monitor and take concrete steps to address the impacts of land use on biodiversity on a broader geographical scale and along increasingly globalized supply chains.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Maia De Souza","given":"Danielle"},{"family":"Teixeira","given":"Ricardo F.M."},{"family":"Ostermann","given":"Ole P."}],"citation-key":"MaiaDeSouza2015_Assessingbiodiversity","container-title":"Global Change Biology","DOI":"10.1111/gcb.12709","ISSN":"1365-2486","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2014 The Authors.

Although there are already Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) methods to measure this impact, they are still rarely used by companies and municipalities in the life cycle assessment of products and processes. Therefore, this paper highlights four main requirements for a biodiversity methodological framework within LCIA in order to facilitate biodiversity assessments: first, to consider the global uneven distribution of biodiversity and its risks with respect to vulnerability and irreplaceability; second, to account for the need to regionalize the impacts of land use; third, to consider the specific impacts that different land use types have on biodiversity; and fourth, to analyze the biodiversity impacts of different land use management parameters and their influence on the intensity of land use. To this end, we provided a review of existing methods in respect to conformity and research gaps. The present publication describes the development of a new methodological framework that builds on these requirements in a three-level hierarchical framework, which enables the assessment of biodiversity in LCA at a global-scale. This publication reveals research gaps regarding the inclusion of proactive and reactive conservation concepts as well as methods of land management into LCIA methodology. The main objective of this concept paper is therefore to describe a new methodological framework for the assessment of biodiversity in the LCA that could fill some of the research gaps, including compilation and suggestion of suitable data sets. The conclusion discusses both the benefits and limitations of this framework.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Maier","given":"Stephanie D."},{"family":"Lindner","given":"Jan Paul"},{"family":"Francisco","given":"Javier"}],"citation-key":"Maier2019_ConceptualFramework","container-title":"Sustainability","DOI":"10.3390/su11071841","ISSN":"2071-1050","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",1]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"7","page":"1841","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"Conceptual Framework for Biodiversity Assessments in Global Value Chains","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/11/7/1841","volume":"11"},{"id":"Maier2023_Biodiversitymultiscale","author":[{"family":"Maier","given":"Stephanie"},{"family":"Leistner","given":"Philip"},{"family":"Uusitalo","given":"Ville"},{"family":"Lindner","given":"Jan Paul"}],"citation-key":"Maier2023_Biodiversitymultiscale","collection-number":"vol. 57","collection-title":"Forschungsergebnisse aus der Bauphysik","contributor":[{"literal":"Universität Stuttgart"},{"literal":"Fraunhofer-Institut für Bauphysik"}],"event-place":"Stuttgart","ISBN":"978-3-8396-1978-0","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"language":"en","note":"phd Thesis","number-of-pages":"330","publisher":"Fraunhofer Verlag","publisher-place":"Stuttgart","source":"K10plus ISBN","title":"Biodiversity multi-scale assessments of product systems: the BioMAPS method","title-short":"Biodiversity multi-scale assessments of product systems","type":"book"},{"id":"Mandard2022_shouldersgiants","abstract":"While citations have been established as a scientific norm used to support assertions and to acknowledge the contribution of past authors, research has widely shown that they are often employed for other motives, such as influencing reviewers, increasing citation rates, or showing erudition.

They examined the five basic factors that determine and, in their interactions, ultimately limit growth on this planet-population increase, agricultural production, nonrenewable resource depletion, industrial output, and pollution generation. The MIT team fed data on these five factors into a global computer model and then tested the behaviour of the model under several sets of assumptions to determine alternative patterns for humankind’s future. The Limits to Growth is the nontechnical report of their findings. The book contains a message of hope as well.

Today, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is increasingly used to assess and compare the environmental sustainability of agricultural products from conventional and organic agriculture. However, LCA studies comparing agricultural products from conventional and organic farming systems report a wide variation in the resource efﬁciency of products from these systems. The studies show that impacts per area farmed land are usually less in organic systems, but related to the quantity produced impacts are often higher. We reviewed 34 comparative LCA studies of organic and conventional agricultural products to analyze whether this result is solely due to the usually lower yields in organic systems or also due to inaccurate modeling within LCA. Comparative LCAs on agricultural products from organic and conventional farming systems often do not adequately differentiate the speciﬁc characteristics of the respective farming system in the goal and scope deﬁnition and in the inventory analysis. Further, often only a limited number of impact categories are assessed within the impact assessment not allowing for a comprehensive environmental assessment. The most critical points we identiﬁed relate to the nitrogen (N) ﬂuxes inﬂuencing acidiﬁcation, eutrophication, and global warming potential, and biodiversity. Usually, N-emissions in LCA inventories of agricultural products are based on model calculations. Modeled N-emissions often do not correspond with the actual amount of N left in the system that may result in potential emissions. Reasons for this may be that N-models are not well adapted to the mode of action of organic fertilizers and that N-emission models often are built on assumptions from conventional agriculture leading to even greater deviances for organic systems between the amount of N calculated by emission models and the actual amount of N available for emissions. Improvements are needed regarding a more precise differentiation between farming systems and regarding the development of N emission models that better represent actual N-ﬂuxes within different systems. We recommend adjusting N- and C-emissions during farmyard manure management and farmyard manure fertilization in plant production to the feed ration provided in the animal production of the respective farming system leading to different N- and C-compositions within the excrement. In the future, more representative background data on organic farming systems (e.g. N content of farmyard manure) should be generated and compiled so as to be available for use within LCA inventories. Finally, we recommend conducting consequential LCA e if possible e when using LCA for policy-making or strategic environmental planning to account for different functions of the analyzed farming systems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",3,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Meier","given":"Matthias S."},{"family":"Stoessel","given":"Franziska"},{"family":"Jungbluth","given":"Niels"},{"family":"Juraske","given":"Ronnie"},{"family":"Schader","given":"Christian"},{"family":"Stolze","given":"Matthias"}],"citation-key":"Meier2015_Environmentalimpacts","container-title":"Journal of Environmental Management","container-title-short":"Journal of Environmental Management","DOI":"10.1016/j.jenvman.2014.10.006","ISSN":"03014797","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",2]]},"language":"en","page":"193-208","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Environmental impacts of organic and conventional agricultural products – Are the differences captured by life cycle assessment?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0301479714004964","volume":"149"},{"id":"Michelsen2008_Assessmentland","abstract":"Land use and changes in land use have a significant impact on biodiversity.

Unfortunately there is no widely accepted assessment method so far for land use impacts. This paper presents an attempt, within the UNEP-SETAC Life Cycle Initiative, to provide a framework for the Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) of land use.Materials and Methods:This framework builds from previous documents, particularly the SETAC book on LCIA (Lindeijer et al. 2002), developing essential issues such as the reference for occupation impacts; the impact pathways to be included in the analysis; the units of measure in the impact mechanism (land use interventions to impacts); the ways to deal with impacts in the future; and bio-geographical differentiation.Results:The paper describes the selected impact pathways, linking the land use elementary flows (occupation; transformation) and parameters (intensity) registered in the inventory (LCI) to the midpoint impact indicators and to the relevant damage categories (natural environment and natural resources). An impact occurs when the land properties are modified (transformation) and also when the current man-made properties are maintained (occupation).Discussion:The size of impact is the difference between the effect on land quality from the studied case of land use and a suitable reference land use on the same area (dynamic reference situation). The impact depends not only on the type of land use (including coverage and intensity) but is also heavily influenced by the bio-geographical conditions of the area. The time lag between the land use intervention and the impact may be large; thus land use impacts should be calculated over a reasonable time period after the actual land use finishes, at least until a new steady state in land quality is reached.Conclusions:Guidance is provided on the definition of the dynamic reference situation and on methods and time frame to assess the impacts occurring after the actual land use. Including the occupation impacts acknowledges that humans are not the sole users of land.Recommendations and Perspectives:The main damages affected by land use that should be considered by any method to assess land use impacts in LCIA are: biodiversity (existence value); biotic production potential (including soil fertility and use value of biodiversity); ecological soil quality (including life support functions of soil other than biotic production potential). Bio-geographical differentiation is required for land use impacts, because the same intervention may have different consequences depending on the sensitivity and inherent land quality of the environment where it occurs. For the moment, an indication of how such task could be done and likely bio-geographical parameters to be considered are suggested. The recommendation of indicators for the suggested impact categories is a matter of future research.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Milà i Canals","given":"Llorenç"},{"family":"Bauer","given":"Christian"},{"family":"Depestele","given":"Jochen"},{"family":"Dubreuil","given":"Alain"},{"family":"Freiermuth Knuchel","given":"Ruth"},{"family":"Gaillard","given":"Gérard"},{"family":"Michelsen","given":"Ottar"},{"family":"Müller-Wenk","given":"Ruedi"},{"family":"Rydgren","given":"Bernt"}],"citation-key":"MilaiCanals2007_KeyElements","container-title":"The International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment","container-title-short":"Int J Life Cycle Assessment","DOI":"10.1065/lca2006.05.250","ISSN":"1614-7502","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",1,1]]},"language":"en","number":"1","page":"5-15","source":"Springer Link","title":"Key Elements in a Framework for Land Use Impact Assessment Within LCA","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1065/lca2006.05.250","volume":"12"},{"id":"MilaiCanals2007_Methodassessing","abstract":"Degradation of soil quality is a major concern due to the scarcity of fertile land, and needs to be properly addressed in the environmental assessment of agro-forestry systems. This paper addresses the main issues arising in assessing the impacts of fertile land use on “Life Support Functions” in Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). These issues include the assessment of occupation and transformation impacts, the references against which such impacts should be measured, and the concept of natural relaxation versus backup technology for recovery from the impacts. The alternative (or reference) situation is defined using the concept of consequential LCA, which facilitates clarification of the allocation issues arising due to successive land uses. This paper presents soil organic matter (SOM) as a robust indicator for soil quality; even though it does not fully consider all aspects of soil functioning, SOM has been often recognised as the best stand-alone indicator for soil quality. Impacts on biodiversity are not included in this indicator and should be assessed in parallel. Alternative data sources for practical implementation of the method are suggested in a hierarchical way, including locally specific data sets describing changes in SOM; mechanistic models for the prediction of SOM evolution; and general data sources for simplified analyses. Thanks to its flexibility in data collection the method is applicable to any agricultural or forestry LCA to fill an important gap in Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) of land use.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Milà i Canals","given":"Llorenç"},{"family":"Romanyà","given":"Joan"},{"family":"Cowell","given":"Sarah J."}],"citation-key":"MilaiCanals2007_Methodassessing","container-title":"Journal of Cleaner Production","container-title-short":"Journal of Cleaner Production","DOI":"10.1016/j.jclepro.2006.05.005","ISSN":"0959-6526","issue":"15","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",10,1]]},"number":"15","page":"1426-1440","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Method for assessing impacts on life support functions (LSF) related to the use of ‘fertile land’ in Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652606001600","volume":"15"},{"id":"Milot2020_DimensionsEvolutionary","abstract":"It is now well admitted by ecologists that the conservation of biodiversity should imply preserving the evolutionary processes that will permit its adaptation to ongoing and future environmental changes. This is attested by the ever-growing reference to the conservation of evolutionary potential in the scientific literature. The impression that one may have when reading papers is that conserving evolutionary potential can only be a good thing, whatever biological system is under scrutiny. However, different objectives, such as maintaining species richness versus ecosystem services, may express different, when not conflicting, underlying values attributed to biodiversity. For instance, biodiversity can be intrinsically valued, as worth it to be conserved per se, or it can be conserved as a means for human flourishing. Consequently, both the concept of evolutionary potential and the prescriptions derived from the commitment to conserve it remain problematic, due to a lack of explicit mention of the norms underlying different conservation visions. Here, we contend that those who advocate for the conservation of evolutionary potential should position their conception along four dimensions: what vehicles instantiate the evolutionary potential relevant to their normative commitment; what temporality is involved; how measurable evolutionary potential is, and what degree of human influence is tolerated. We need to address these dimensions if we are to determine why and when the maintenance of evolutionary potential is an appropriate target for the conservation of biodiversity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",6,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Milot","given":"Emmanuel"},{"family":"Béchet","given":"Arnaud"},{"family":"Maris","given":"Virginie"}],"citation-key":"Milot2020_DimensionsEvolutionary","container-title":"Evolutionary Applications","DOI":"10.1111/eva.12995","ISSN":"1752-4571","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2020 The Authors.

Indices aim to describe general properties of communities that allow us to compare different regions, taxa, and trophic levels. Therefore, they are of fundamental importance for environmental monitoring and conservation, although there is no consensus about which indices are more appropriate and informative. We tested several common diversity indices in a range of simple to complex statistical analyses in order to determine whether some were better suited for certain analyses than others. We used data collected around the focal plant Plantago lanceolata on 60 temperate grassland plots embedded in an agricultural landscape to explore relationships between the common diversity indices of species richness (S), Shannon's diversity (H'), Simpson's diversity (D1), Simpson's dominance (D2), Simpson's evenness (E), and Berger–Parker dominance (BP). We calculated each of these indices for herbaceous plants, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, aboveground arthropods, belowground insect larvae, and P. lanceolata molecular and chemical diversity. Including these trait-based measures of diversity allowed us to test whether or not they behaved similarly to the better studied species diversity. We used path analysis to determine whether compound indices detected more relationships between diversities of different organisms and traits than more basic indices. In the path models, more paths were significant when using H', even though all models except that with E were equally reliable. This demonstrates that while common diversity indices may appear interchangeable in simple analyses, when considering complex interactions, the choice of index can profoundly alter the interpretation of results. Data mining in order to identify the index producing the most significant results should be avoided, but simultaneously considering analyses using multiple indices can provide greater insight into the interactions in a system.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",3,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Morris","given":"E.

Thus, we review recent literature on microbial community assembly, using the framework of Vellend (Q. Rev. Biol. 85:183–206, 2010) in an effort to synthesize and unify these contributions. We begin by discussing patterns in microbial biogeography and then describe four basic processes (diversification, dispersal, selection, and drift) that contribute to community assembly. We also discuss different combinations of these processes and where and when they may be most important for shaping microbial communities. The spatial and temporal scales of microbial community assembly are also discussed in relation to assembly processes. Throughout this review paper, we highlight differences between microbes and macroorganisms and generate hypotheses describing how these differences may be important for community assembly. We end by discussing the implications of microbial assembly processes for ecosystem function and biodiversity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",6,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Nemergut","given":"Diana R."},{"family":"Schmidt","given":"Steven K."},{"family":"Fukami","given":"Tadashi"},{"family":"O'Neill","given":"Sean P."},{"family":"Bilinski","given":"Teresa M."},{"family":"Stanish","given":"Lee F."},{"family":"Knelman","given":"Joseph E."},{"family":"Darcy","given":"John L."},{"family":"Lynch","given":"Ryan C."},{"family":"Wickey","given":"Phillip"},{"family":"Ferrenberg","given":"Scott"}],"citation-key":"Nemergut2013_PatternsProcesses","container-title":"Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews","DOI":"10.1128/mmbr.00051-12","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",9,4]]},"page":"342-356","publisher":"American Society for Microbiology","source":"journals.asm.org (Atypon)","title":"Patterns and Processes of Microbial Community Assembly","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/mmbr.00051-12","volume":"77"},{"id":"Newbold2015_Globaleffects","abstract":"Human activities, especially conversion and degradation of habitats, are causing global biodiversity declines.

Here we show that in the worst-affected habitats, these pressures reduce within-sample species richness by an average of 76.5%, total abundance by 39.5% and rarefaction-based richness by 40.3%. We estimate that, globally, these pressures have already slightly reduced average within-sample richness (by 13.6%), total abundance (10.7%) and rarefaction-based richness (8.1%), with changes showing marked spatial variation. Rapid further losses are predicted under a business-as-usual land-use scenario; within-sample richness is projected to fall by a further 3.4% globally by 2100, with losses concentrated in biodiverse but economically poor countries.

Differences among land uses in the diversity of local assemblages (alpha diversity) have been quantified at a global scale. Effects on the turnover of species composition between locations (beta diversity) are less clear, with previous studies focusing on particular regions or groups of species. Using a global database on the composition of ecological assemblages in different land uses, we test for differences in the between-site turnover of species composition, within and among land-use types. Overall, we show a strong impact of land use on assemblage composition. While we find that compositional turnover within land uses does not differ strongly among land uses, human land uses and secondary vegetation in an early stage of recovery are poor at retaining the species that characterise primary vegetation. The dissimilarity of assemblages in human-impacted habitats compared with primary vegetation was more pronounced in the tropical than temperate realm. An exploratory analysis suggests that this geographic difference might be caused primarily by differences in climate seasonality and in the numbers of species sampled. Taken together the results suggest that, while small-scale beta diversity within land uses is not strongly impacted by land-use type, compositional turnover between land uses is substantial. Therefore, land-use change will lead to profound changes in the structure of ecological assemblages.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",5,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Newbold","given":"Tim"},{"family":"Hudson","given":"Lawrence N."},{"family":"Hill","given":"Samantha L.

It has been regarded as too broad and vague a concept to be applied to real‐world regulatory and management problems. This problem can be corrected if biodiversity is recognized as an end in itself, and if measurable indicators can be selected to assess the status of biodiversity over time. Biodiversity, as presently understood, encompasses multiple levels of biological organization. In this paper, I expand the three primary attributes of biodiversity recognized by Jerry Franklin — composition, structure, and function—into a nested hierarchy that incorporates elements of each attribute at four levels of organization: regional landscape, community‐ecosystem, population‐species, and genetic. Indicators of each attribute in terrestrial ecosystems, at the four levels of organization, are identified for environmental monitoring purposes. Projects to monitor biodiversity will benefit from a direct linkage to long‐term ecological research and a commitment to test hypotheses relevant to biodiversity conservation. A general guideline is to proceed from the top down, beginning with a coarse‐scale inventory of landscape pattern, vegetation, habitat structure, and species distributions, then overlaying data on stress levels to identify biologically significant areas at high risk of impoverishment. Intensive research and monitoring can be directed to high‐risk ecosystems and elements of biodiversity, while less intensive monitoring is directed to the total landscape (or samples thereof). In any monitoring program, particular attention should be paid to specifying the questions that monitoring is intended to answer and validating the relationships between indicators and the components of biodiversity they represent.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",3,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Noss","given":"Reed F."}],"citation-key":"Noss1990_IndicatorsMonitoring","container-title":"Conservation Biology","container-title-short":"Conservation Biology","DOI":"10.1111/j.1523-1739.1990.tb00309.x","ISSN":"0888-8892, 1523-1739","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["1990",12]]},"language":"en","page":"355-364","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Indicators for Monitoring Biodiversity: A Hierarchical Approach","title-short":"Indicators for Monitoring Biodiversity","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1523-1739.1990.tb00309.x","volume":"4"},{"id":"Nunez2013_Inclusionsoil","abstract":"Despite the fundamental role of ecosystem goods and services in sustaining human activities, there is no harmonized and internationally agreed method for including them in life cycle assessment (LCA).

Existing methods of life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) do not include any soil quality indicators other than soil organic matter content. This paper rectifies this omission by presenting Swiss Agricultural Life Cycle Assessment for Soil Quality (SALCA-SQ), a LCIA conform method, to assess effects of agricultural management practices on soil quality. SALCA-SQ characterises all major types of impacts of land management practices on the quality of arable soils by means of nine indicators covering soil physical, chemical and biological aspects: rooting depth of soil, macropore volume, aggregate stability, organic carbon content, heavy metal content, organic pollutants, earthworm biomass, microbial biomass and microbial activity. Since these indicators are not measured directly, the impacts of agricultural management activities are assessed via impact class modelling to determine the most probable changes in soil quality indicators as a result of on-farm agricultural practices. To illustrate the application and results of SALCA-SQ, treatment effects of a long-term field trial on soil quality were assessed and compared against measured field data. The data generated by SALCA-SQ revealed the important influence of fertiliser regime on soil quality. Field measurements generally confirmed SALCA-SQ assessments, but small differences between measured data in different treatments could not be predicted. Case studies on theoretical scenarios covering a broad spectrum of site conditions and management practices demonstrated the potential of SALCA-SQ to assess the effects of the major impact classes on the nine soil quality indicators, thus giving a refined picture of the potential effects of a farming system on soil quality. In principle, these results support the assumption that SALCA-SQ has the potential to assess effects of agricultural management practices on soil quality, but validity in a strict scientific sense remains to be substantiated. In addition, SALCA-SQ can be used by agricultural advisory services and farmers to analyse agricultural management effects on soil quality and move soil management in a more sustainable direction.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Oberholzer","given":"Hans-Rudolf"},{"family":"Freiermuth Knuchel","given":"Ruth"},{"family":"Weisskopf","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Gaillard","given":"Gérard"}],"citation-key":"Oberholzer2012_novelmethod","container-title":"Agronomy for Sustainable Development","container-title-short":"Agron.

Nonetheless, remarkable progress has been made in recent years toward developing strategies to characterize and describe soil biodiversity, especially thanks to the development of molecular approaches relying on direct DNA extraction from the soil matrix. Metabarcoding can be applied to DNA from any environment or organism, and is gaining increasing prominence in biodiversity studies. This approach is already commonly used to characterize soil microbial communities and its application is now being extended to other soil organisms, i.e. meso- and macro-fauna. These developments offer unprecedented scientific and operational opportunities in order to better understand soil biodiversity distribution and dynamics, and to propose tools and strategies for biodiversity diagnosis. However, these opportunities also come with challenges that the scientific community must face. Such challenges are related to i) clarification of terminology, (ii) standardisation of methods and further methodological development for additional taxonomic groups, (iii) development of a common database, and (iv) ways to avoid waste of information and data derived from metabarcoding. In order to facilitate common application of metabarcoding in soil biodiversity assessment, we discuss these opportunities and challenges and propose solutions towards a more homogeneous framework.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",5,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Orgiazzi","given":"Alberto"},{"family":"Dunbar","given":"Martha Bonnet"},{"family":"Panagos","given":"Panos"},{"family":"Groot","given":"Gerard Arjen","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Lemanceau","given":"Philippe"}],"citation-key":"Orgiazzi2015_Soilbiodiversity","container-title":"Soil Biology and Biochemistry","container-title-short":"Soil Biology and Biochemistry","DOI":"10.1016/j.soilbio.2014.10.014","ISSN":"0038-0717","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",1,1]]},"page":"244-250","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Soil biodiversity and DNA barcodes: opportunities and challenges","title-short":"Soil biodiversity and DNA barcodes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038071714003617","volume":"80"},{"id":"Orgiazzi2016_knowledgebasedapproach","abstract":"Because of the increasing pressures exerted on soil, below-ground life is under threat. Knowledge-based rankings of potential threats to different components of soil biodiversity were developed in order to assess the spatial distribution of threats on a European scale. A list of 13 potential threats to soil biodiversity was proposed to experts with different backgrounds in order to assess the potential for three major components of soil biodiversity: soil microorganisms, fauna, and biological functions. This approach allowed us to obtain knowledge-based rankings of threats. These classifications formed the basis for the development of indices through an additive aggregation model that, along with ad-hoc proxies for each pressure, allowed us to preliminarily assess the spatial patterns of potential threats. Intensive exploitation was identified as the highest pressure. In contrast, the use of genetically modified organisms in agriculture was considered as the threat with least potential. The potential impact of climate change showed the highest uncertainty. Fourteen out of the 27 considered countries have more than 40% of their soils with moderate-high to high potential risk for all three components of soil biodiversity. Arable soils are the most exposed to pressures. Soils within the boreal biogeographic region showed the lowest risk potential. The majority of soils at risk are outside the boundaries of protected areas. First maps of risks to three components of soil biodiversity based on the current scientific knowledge were developed. Despite the intrinsic limits of knowledge-based assessments, a remarkable potential risk to soil biodiversity was observed. Guidelines to preliminarily identify and circumscribe soils potentially at risk are provided. This approach may be used in future research to assess threat at both local and global scale and identify areas of possible risk and, subsequently, design appropriate strategies for monitoring and protection of soil biota.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",5,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Orgiazzi","given":"Alberto"},{"family":"Panagos","given":"Panos"},{"family":"Yigini","given":"Yusuf"},{"family":"Dunbar","given":"Martha B."},{"family":"Gardi","given":"Ciro"},{"family":"Montanarella","given":"Luca"},{"family":"Ballabio","given":"Cristiano"}],"citation-key":"Orgiazzi2016_knowledgebasedapproach","container-title":"Science of The Total Environment","container-title-short":"Science of The Total Environment","DOI":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.12.092","ISSN":"0048-9697","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",3,1]]},"page":"11-20","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"A knowledge-based approach to estimating the magnitude and spatial patterns of potential threats to soil biodiversity","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004896971531247X","volume":"545-546"},{"id":"Orgiazzi2018_LUCASSoil","abstract":"Soil is a non-renewable resource that requires constant monitoring to prevent its degradation and promote its sustainable management. The ‘Land Use/Cover Area frame statistical Survey Soil’ (LUCAS Soil) is an extensive and regular topsoil survey that is carried out across the European Union to derive policy-relevant statistics on the effect of land management on soil characteristics. Approximately 45 000 soil samples have been collected from two time-periods, 2009–2012 and 2015. A new sampling series will be undertaken in 2018, with new measurements included. The organization for the 2018 sampling campaign represents an opportunity to summarize past LUCAS Soil achievements and present its future objectives. In 2009–2012 and 2015, LUCAS Soil surveys targeted physicochemical properties, including pH, organic carbon, nutrient concentrations and cation exchange capacity. Data from 2009–2012 (ca. 22 000 points) and derived output (more than 20 maps) are available freely from the European Soil Data Centre website. Analyses of samples collected during 2015 are ongoing and data will be available at the end of 2017. In the 2018 LUCAS Soil sampling campaign, additional properties, including bulk density, soil biodiversity, specific measurements for organic-rich soil and soil erosion will be measured. Here we present the current dataset (LUCAS Soil 2009–2012 and 2015), its potential for reuse and future development plans (LUCAS Soil 2018 and over). LUCAS Soil represents the largest harmonized open-access dataset of topsoil properties available for the European Union at the global scale. It was developed as an expandable resource, with the possibility to add new properties and sampling locations during successive sampling campaigns. Data are available to the scientific community and decision makers, thus contributing to both research and the development of the land-focused policy agenda. Highlights LUCAS Soil consists of soil physicochemical and biological properties data from Europe. Harmonized and open-access dataset allowing inclusion of soil in large-scale inter-disciplinary assessments.

No current LCA method is able to assess and compare impacts on the biodiversity of vegetable production systems as a function of farming practices and the local context. Based on a literature review and consultation with experts, the SALCABD expert system, originally designed to assess impacts on the biodiversity of cropland and grassland at field, rotation, and farm levels, was adapted to vegetable production systems. SALCA-BD is based on an inventory of the habitats found on a farm and a list of practices that can be implemented in these habitats. We distinguished an open field and a greenhouse as two distinct “level I” habitats, as a habitat’s openness favours the exchange of species with surrounding habitats. These two habitats were subdivided into “level II” habitats that corresponded to vegetable crops. Given the many types of vegetables, we used a clustering method to create a few categories that grouped vegetables that had similar potential to host biodiversity. We created a category for intercropped vegetables for fields in which multiple vegetables are grown at the same time, which is common on microfarms. We tested the expert system at field and farm levels using scenarios and a farm case study. We quantified effects of changes to individual practices and practice intensities at the field level on biodiversity. The results highlighted the importance of semi-natural habitats for preserving biodiversity, in addition to low-intensity practices, which indicates that assessment at the farm level is more informative than that at the field level. Because it considers habitats and practices in detail, SALCA-BD is useful for assessing biodiversity at field and farm levels and for comparing farming systems with the same land use and type of management (organic or conventional), which other LCA methods for assessing biodiversity cannot do. Field size, which is a driver of biodiversity, is considered indirectly only when semi-natural habitats are included. As SALCA-BD does not consider impacts of the background system, combining SALCA-BD with comprehensive methods for assessing impacts on biodiversity is a promising perspective for more complete assessment.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Pépin","given":"Antonin"},{"family":"Guidoboni","given":"Maria Vittoria"},{"family":"Jeanneret","given":"Philippe"},{"family":"Van Der Werf","given":"Hayo M.G."}],"citation-key":"Pepin2023_Usingexpert","container-title":"Ecological Indicators","container-title-short":"Ecological Indicators","DOI":"10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.110098","ISSN":"1470160X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",4]]},"language":"en","page":"110098","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Using an expert system to assess biodiversity in life cycle assessment of vegetable crops","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1470160X23002406","volume":"148"},{"id":"Pereira2006_ModelingBiodiversity","abstract":"The future of biodiversity hinges to a great extent on the conservation value of countryside, the growing fraction of Earth's surface heavily influenced by human activities. How many species, and which species, can persist in such landscapes (and analogous seascapes) are open questions. Here we explore two complementary theoretical frameworks to address these questions: species–area relationships and demographic models. We use the terrestrial mammal fauna of Central America to illustrate the application of both frameworks. We begin by proposing a multi-habitat species–area relationship, the countryside species–area relationship, to forecast species extinction rates. To apply it, we classify the mammal fauna by affinity to native and human-dominated habitats. We show how considering the conservation value of countryside habitats changes estimates derived from the classic species–area approach We also examine how the z value of the species–area relationship affects extinction estimates. Next, we present a framework for assessing the relative vulnerability of species to extinction in the countryside, based on the Skellam model of population dynamics. This model predicts the minimum area of contiguous native habitat required for persistence of a species, which we use as an indicator of vulnerability to habitat change. To apply the model, we use our habitat affinity classification of mammals and we estimate life-history parameters by species and habitat type. The resulting ranking of vulnerabilities is significantly correlated with the World Conservation Union (IUCN) Red List assessment.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Pereira","given":"Henrique M."},{"family":"Daily","given":"Gretchen C."}],"citation-key":"Pereira2006_ModelingBiodiversity","container-title":"Ecology","DOI":"10.1890/0012-9658(2006)87[1877:MBDICL]2.0.CO;2","ISSN":"1939-9170","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2006 by the Ecological Society of America","number":"8","page":"1877-1885","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Modeling Biodiversity Dynamics in Countryside Landscapes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1890/0012-9658%282006%2987%5B1877%3AMBDICL%5D2.0.CO%3B2","volume":"87"},{"id":"Pereira2013_EssentialBiodiversity","abstract":"Reducing the rate of biodiversity loss and averting dangerous biodiversity change are international goals, reasserted by the Aichi Targets for 2020 by Parties to the United Nations (UN) Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) after failure to meet the 2010 target (1, 2).

I argue that the recognition of intrinsic natural value is a fundamental and non-negotiable aspect of an eco-evolutionary worldview. Recently, relational values, “preferences, principles, and virtues associated with relationships”, have been proposed as a third category of values in nature, which may help to resolve the debate between instrumental and intrinsic valuation. By depicting intrinsic values as part of an unhelpful dichotomy between anthropocentric and ecocentric values, the current assessment of relational values fails to adequately account for the modern philosophical view of intrinsic natural value. The recognition of intrinsic natural value is not merely an academic exercise, but rather a vital aspect of conservation of the biosphere; recognition of value entails the obligation to do what is right, i.e., protect the good. Any attempt to reframe the discussion about values and environmental protection through more formal recognition of relational values will need to more clearly address how relational and intrinsic values coexist and how they can jointly form the basis for nature conservation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",6,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Piccolo","given":"John J."}],"citation-key":"Piccolo2017_IntrinsicValues","container-title":"Journal for Nature Conservation","container-title-short":"Journal for Nature Conservation","DOI":"10.1016/j.jnc.2017.02.007","ISSN":"1617-1381","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",6,1]]},"page":"8-11","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Intrinsic values in nature: Objective good or simply half of an unhelpful dichotomy?","title-short":"Intrinsic values in nature","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1617138117300742","volume":"37"},{"id":"Potapov2019_TrophicConsistency","abstract":"Organisms of the same species usually share morphology and have similar feeding habits. By contrast, different species typically differ in morphology and feed on different food sources. However, morphological differences among species vary strongly– some species look very similar, whereas others are distinct. Morphologically similar species are combined to higher taxonomic groups that form a consistent hierarchical system – species are grouped to genera, genera to families etc. The fundamental question we ask in our study is, does the classification of organisms based on morphological differences explain variations in their feeding habits? Essentially this asks, if two organisms look different, do they also eat different things? Soil and dead material on its surface (plant litter) are inhabited by a huge diversity of organisms, challenging studies on their morphological and trophic variability. We focused on several ancient evolutionary lineages of invertebrates including insects, mites, spiders, myriapods, woodlice and earthworms. To get insight into their feeding habits, we used stable isotope analysis of animal tissue, that provides information on the diet over last weeks, months or even years without direct observations of animal feeding interactions, which is indeed difficult in soil. We found that differences in the feeding habits among organisms are related to morphological differences between them (as reflected by taxonomic groups). More than 50% of the variation in the trophic position of animals was explained by the differences among very broad groups, such as classes and orders, that encompass thousands of species. We also showed that trophic niches within taxonomic groups are “consistent”, i.e. feeding habits of species within taxonomic groups are similar. Interestingly, more diverse taxonomic groups also were more variable in their feeding habits reflecting a link between diversification in morphology and feeding habits during the life history. Our study pushes forward the understanding of cryptic belowground communities, and facilitates modelling and predicting their response to global and local changes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",5,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Potapov","given":"Anton M."},{"family":"Scheu","given":"Stefan"},{"family":"Tiunov","given":"Alexei V."}],"citation-key":"Potapov2019_TrophicConsistency","container-title":"Functional Ecology","DOI":"10.1111/1365-2435.13309","ISSN":"1365-2435","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1172-1183","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","source":"besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com","title":"Trophic consistency of supraspecific taxa in below-ground invertebrate communities: Comparison across lineages and taxonomic ranks","title-short":"Trophic consistency of supraspecific taxa in below-ground invertebrate communities","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2435.13309","volume":"33"},{"id":"Potapov2022_Multifunctionalitybelowground","abstract":"The belowground compartment of terrestrial ecosystems drives nutrient cycling, the decomposition and stabilisation of organic matter, and supports aboveground life. Belowground consumers create complex food webs that regulate functioning, ensure stability and support biodiversity both below and above ground. However, existing soil food-web reconstructions do not match recently accumulated empirical evidence and there is no comprehensive reproducible approach that accounts for the complex resource, size and spatial structure of food webs in soil. Here I build on generic food-web organisation principles and use multifunctional classification of soil protists, invertebrates and vertebrates, to reconstruct a ‘multichannel’ food web across size classes of soil-associated consumers. I infer weighted trophic interactions among trophic guilds using feeding preferences and prey protection traits (evolutionarily inherited traits), size and spatial distributions (niche overlaps), and biomass-dependent feeding. I then use food-web reconstruction, together with assimilation efficiencies, to calculate energy fluxes assuming a steady-state energetic system. Based on energy fluxes, I propose a number of indicators, related to stability, biodiversity and multiple ecosystem-level functions such as herbivory, top-down control, translocation and transformation of organic matter. I illustrate this approach with an empirical example, comparing it with traditional resource-focused soil food-web reconstruction. The multichannel reconstruction can be used to assess ‘trophic multifunctionality’ (analogous to ecosystem multifunctionality), i.e. simultaneous support of multiple trophic functions by the food web, and compare it across communities and ecosystems spanning beyond the soil. With further empirical validation of the proposed functional indicators, this multichannel reconstruction approach could provide an effective tool for understanding animal diversity–ecosystem functioning relationships in soil. This tool hopefully will inspire more researchers to describe soil communities and belowground–aboveground interactions comprehensively. Such studies will provide informative indicators for including consumers as active agents in biogeochemical models, not only locally but also on regional and global scales.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",5,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Potapov","given":"Anton M."}],"citation-key":"Potapov2022_Multifunctionalitybelowground","container-title":"Biological Reviews","DOI":"10.1111/brv.12857","ISSN":"1469-185X","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2022 The Author.

The basis for this challenge arises from four sources: the original papers published in the nineteenth century, empirical studies published throughout the twentieth century, theoretical considerations of organic matter composition, and a consideration of what led to the popularity and general acceptance of the conventional factor. The conventional factor of 1.724, based on the assumption that soil organic matter contains 58% carbon, applies only to some soils or only to particular components of soil organic matter. Studies published since the end of the nineteenth century have consistently shown that the factor of 1.724 is too low for most soils. In a review of previously published data, the median value for the conversion factor was found to be 1.9 from empirical studies and 2 from more theoretical considerations. A factor of 2, based on the assumption that organic matter is 50% carbon, would in almost all cases be more accurate than the conventional factor of 1.724. A consideration of the possible variation in organic matter composition predicts a range of factor values between 1.4 and 2.5, a range that is narrower than empirical results at least in part because of the interaction between the methods used to estimate organic matter and soil composition. Convenience, authority, and tradition rather than strength of evidence are in large part responsible for the widespread acceptance of the conventional factor.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",6,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Pribyl","given":"Douglas W."}],"citation-key":"Pribyl2010_CriticalReview","container-title":"Geoderma","container-title-short":"Geoderma","DOI":"10.1016/j.geoderma.2010.02.003","ISSN":"0016-7061","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",5,15]]},"page":"75-83","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"A critical review of the conventional SOC to SOM conversion factor","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016706110000388","volume":"156"},{"id":"Prosser2015_Dispersingmisconceptions","abstract":"In this Opinion article, James Prosser considers the conceptual limitations of metagenomics and metatranscriptomics in contributing to our understanding of soil microbial ecology, and also explores potential opportunities for using these techniques to address specific ecological questions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",4,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Prosser","given":"James I."}],"citation-key":"Prosser2015_Dispersingmisconceptions","container-title":"Nature Reviews Microbiology","container-title-short":"Nat Rev Microbiol","DOI":"10.1038/nrmicro3468","ISSN":"1740-1534","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",7]]},"language":"en","license":"2015 Springer Nature Limited","page":"439-446","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Dispersing misconceptions and identifying opportunities for the use of 'omics' in soil microbial ecology","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/nrmicro3468","volume":"13"},{"id":"PublicationsOfficeoftheEuropeanUnion2016_GlobalSoil","abstract":"What is soil biodiversity? How does it vary in space and time? What does it provide to society? What are the main threats to soil biodiversity? What can we do to preserve it? The first ever Global Soil Biodiversity Atlas uses informative texts, stunning photographs and striking maps to answer and explain these and other questions. Going through its nine chapters, every reader will learn what soils are and about the amazing creatures living in them. You will discover the factors influencing the distribution of soil organisms, how soil biodiversity supports food production, the pressures affecting soil life and the possible interventions to preserve it. The Global Soil Biodiversity Atlas is an essential reference to understand and appreciate the incredible world living under our feet. Soil is an extremely complex system resulting from the essential interactions between inert and living components. Soils host a myriad of soil organisms ranging in size from a few micrometres to several centimetres, from the microscopic bacteria and archaea to the “giant” earthworms and moles. All these organisms are distributed over space and time, and each ecosystem and season has its unique soil community. Soil organisms interact to provide essential ecosystem services to human beings and the environment, ranging from supporting plant growth to the regulation of climate. Soils are increasingly under pressure and so are the organisms living in them. Intensive agriculture, loss of aboveground biodiversity, soil erosion and land degradation are among the most relevant threats to soil life. We can protect soil creatures by taking specific actions. No-tillage, diversification of crops, increasing reforestation and greater use of natural amendments are examples of interventions that may promote life in soils. People need to know about the fascinating world belowground and understand its value. The Global Soil Biodiversity Atlas presents the often neglected protagonists in the environment that surrounds us all.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",5,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Orgiazzi","given":"Alberto"},{"family":"Johnson","given":"Nancy C."},{"family":"Scheu","given":"Stefan"},{"family":"Ramirez","given":"Kelly S."},{"family":"Lemanceau","given":"Philippe"},{"family":"Eggleton","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Jones","given":"Arwyn"},{"family":"Moreira","given":"Fatima M.

Direct statements of these values are often deeply considered, but the ethical implications of structural constraints and upstream analytical choices are often hidden. This is relatively uncontroversial from a philosophical point of view, and well-known to scholars in environmental ethics. However, many practitioners in ecology and evolution without such training (ourselves included) may not have realized that by asserting the value of biodiversity conservation in either general or specific terms, they are stating a “normative postulate:” a value judgment taken to be true and foundational to further thinking. These assumptions are based on some theory of value and ethical reasoning, but often one that has not been made fully explicit. Consequently, many theories and metrics in empirical scientific research may be founded on hidden normative postulates of which practitioners are often unaware. We consider five cases where this may be the case: local vs. global diversity, prioritization based on evolutionary distinctness, species concepts, extinction by hybridization, and non-native species. Conflicts over the interpretation of data driven by different parties holding to different conceptions of ethics and philosophy are possible, with little guidance on how they can best be adjudicated. To the extent this is true, there exists a “normative postulate problem” for biodiversity researchers.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",6,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Pyron","given":"R.

A review of previous geotechnical LCAs showed that most studies have tracked a small set of impact categories, such as energy and global warming potential. Accordingly, currently reported environmental indicators may not effectively or fully capture important environmental impacts and tradeoffs associated with geotechnical systems, including those associated with land and soil resources. This research reviewed previous studies, methods, and models for assessment of land use and soil-related impacts to understand their applicability to geotechnical LCA. The results of this review show that critical gaps remain in current knowledge and practice. In particular, further development or refinement of environmental indicators, impact categories, and cause–effect pathways is needed as they pertain to geotechnical applications—specifically those related to soil quality, soil functions, and the ecosystem services soils provide. In addition, many existing methods emerge from research on land use and land use change related to other disciplines (e.g., agriculture). For applicability to geotechnical projects, the resolution of many of these methods and resulting indicators need to be downscaled from the landscape/macro scale to the project scale. In the near term, practitioners of geotechnical LCA should begin tracking changes to soil properties and report impacts to land and soil resources qualitatively.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Raymond","given":"Alena J."},{"family":"Tipton","given":"James R."},{"family":"Kendall","given":"Alissa"},{"family":"DeJong","given":"Jason T."}],"citation-key":"Raymond2020_Reviewimpact","container-title":"Journal of Industrial Ecology","DOI":"10.1111/jiec.12946","ISSN":"1530-9290","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2019 by Yale University","number":"3","page":"485-499","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Review of impact categories and environmental indicators for life cycle assessment of geotechnical systems","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jiec.12946","volume":"24"},{"id":"Rea2017_ValueNature","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",6,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Rea","given":"Anne W"},{"family":"Munns","given":"Wayne R","suffix":"Jr"}],"citation-key":"Rea2017_ValueNature","container-title":"Integrated Environmental Assessment and Management","container-title-short":"Integrated Environmental Assessment and Management","DOI":"10.1002/ieam.1924","ISSN":"1551-3777","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,1]]},"page":"953-955","source":"Silverchair","title":"The value of nature: Economic, intrinsic, or both?","title-short":"The value of nature","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1002/ieam.1924","volume":"13"},{"id":"Reed2003_CorrelationFitness","abstract":"Genetic diversity is one of the three forms of biodiversity recognized by the World Conservation Union (IUCN) as deserving conservation. The need to conserve genetic diversity within populations is based on two arguments: the necessity of genetic diversity for evolution to occur, and the expected relationship between heterozygosity and population fitness. Because loss of genetic diversity is related to inbreeding, and inbreeding reduces reproductive fitness, a correlation is expected between heterozygosity and population fitness. Long-term effective population size, which determines rates of inbreeding, should also be correlated with fitness. However, other theoretical considerations and empirical observations suggest that the correlation between fitness and heterozygosity may be weak or nonexistent. We used all the data sets we could locate (34) to perform a meta-analysis and resolve the issue. Data sets were included in the study, provided that fitness, or a component of fitness, was measured for three or more populations along with heterozygosity, heritability, and/or population size. The mean weighted correlation between measures of genetic diversity, at the population level, and population fitness was 0.4323. The correlation was highly significant and explained 19% of the variation in fitness.

Existing models mainly focus on species richness and abundance, lacking insights into ecological mechanisms and species’ roles in ecosystem functioning. To bridge this gap, we conducted an extensive analysis of the impact of human land use on vascular plant functional diversity, across diverse land-use classes and bioregions in Europe, comparing it to traditional metrics.\nLocation: Europe Time period: 1992-2019 Major taxa studied: Vascular plants\nMethods Integrating extensive databases of vegetation plots with spatial data on land use and land cover, we paired plots from areas actively used and modified by humans with plots from natural habitats under similar environmental conditions. Using species occurrences and traits, in each plot we computed three complementary functional diversity metrics (functional richness, evenness, and divergence), species richness and abundance. We assessed the impact of land use by comparing the metrics in the paired plots.\nResults Our findings revealed that, compared to natural habitats, anthropogenic land use exhibits lower functional richness and divergence but higher functional evenness across most land-use classes and bioregions. The response of functional richness was more marked than the other two metrics and especially pronounced in croplands and urban areas and in northern bioregions. Functional richness exhibited a pattern that did not fully overlap with the trend in species richness, providing useful complementary information.\nMain conclusions We provide a large-scale precise assessment of anthropogenic land-use impacts on functional diversity across Europe. Our findings indicate that: (i) human disturbance significantly alters plant functional diversity compared to natural habitats; (ii) this alteration goes in the direction of functional homogenization; (i) functional diversity metrics complement traditional metrics by offering deeper insights into the ecological mechanisms in response to anthropogenic land use.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",4,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Rosa","given":"Francesca"},{"family":"Bodegom","given":"Peter M.","dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Hellweg","given":"Stefanie"},{"family":"Pfister","given":"Stephan"},{"family":"Biurrun","given":"Idoia"},{"family":"Boch","given":"Steffen"},{"family":"Chytrý","given":"Milan"},{"family":"Ćušterevska","given":"Renata"},{"family":"Fratte","given":"Michele Dalle"},{"family":"Damasceno","given":"Gabriella"},{"family":"Garbolino","given":"Emmanuel"},{"family":"Lenoir","given":"Jonathan"},{"family":"Ozinga","given":"Wim A."},{"family":"Penuelas","given":"Josep"},{"family":"Sabatini","given":"Francesco Maria"},{"family":"Schrodt","given":"Franziska"},{"family":"Uogintas","given":"Domas"},{"family":"Byun","given":"Chaeho"},{"family":"Dolezal","given":"Jiri"},{"family":"Dziuba","given":"Tetiana"},{"family":"Hérault","given":"Bruno"},{"family":"Martín-Forés","given":"Irene"},{"family":"Niinemets","given":"Ülo"},{"family":"Peyre","given":"Gwendolyn"},{"family":"Scherer","given":"Laura"}],"citation-key":"Rosa2024_Landuseimpacts","container-title":"bioRxiv","DOI":"10.1101/2024.02.21.580945","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,12]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2024, Posted by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.

However, data are lacking regarding their global population abundance. We synthesized thousands of evaluations from around 500 sites worldwide, estimating the absolute biomass and abundance of terrestrial arthropods across different taxa and habitats. We found that there are ≈1 × 1019 (twofold uncertainty range) soil arthropods on Earth, ≈95% of which are soil mites and springtails. The soil contains ≈200 (twofold uncertainty range) million metric tons (Mt) of dry biomass. Termites contribute ≈40% of the soil biomass, much more than ants at ≈10%. Our estimate for the global biomass of above-ground arthropods is more uncertain, highlighting a knowledge gap that future research should aim to close. We estimate the combined dry biomass of all terrestrial arthropods at ≈300 Mt (uncertainty range, 100 to 500), similar to the mass of humanity and its livestock. These estimates enhance the quantitative understanding of arthropods in terrestrial ecosystems and provide an initial holistic benchmark on their decline., Synthesizing local data quantifies arthropods in terrestrial ecosystems and provides an initial benchmark on their decline.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",3,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Rosenberg","given":"Yuval"},{"family":"Bar-On","given":"Yinon M."},{"family":"Fromm","given":"Amir"},{"family":"Ostikar","given":"Meital"},{"family":"Shoshany","given":"Aviv"},{"family":"Giz","given":"Omer"},{"family":"Milo","given":"Ron"}],"citation-key":"Rosenberg2025_globalbiomass","container-title":"Science Advances","container-title-short":"Sci Adv","DOI":"10.1126/sciadv.abq4049","ISSN":"2375-2548","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",3,13]]},"number":"5","page":"eabq4049","PMCID":"PMC9897674","PMID":"36735788","source":"PubMed Central","title":"The global biomass and number of terrestrial arthropods","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9897674/","volume":"9"},{"id":"Ryo2021_ExplainableArtificial","abstract":"Species distribution models (SDMs) are widely used in ecology, biogeography and conservation biology to estimate relationships between environmental variables and species occurrence data and make pre...","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",6,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Ryo","given":"Masahiro"},{"family":"Angelov","given":"Boyan"},{"family":"Mammola","given":"Stefano"},{"family":"Kass","given":"Jamie M."},{"family":"Benito","given":"Blas M."},{"family":"Hartig","given":"Florian"}],"citation-key":"Ryo2021_ExplainableArtificial","container-title":"Ecography","DOI":"10.1111/ecog.05360","ISSN":"1600-0587","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",2,1]]},"language":"en","page":"199-205","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","source":"nsojournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com","title":"Explainable artificial intelligence enhances the ecological interpretability of black-box species distribution models","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://nsojournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ecog.05360","volume":"44"},{"id":"Saad2013_Landuse","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Saad","given":"Rosie"},{"family":"Koellner","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Margni","given":"Manuele"}],"citation-key":"Saad2013_Landuse","container-title":"The International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment","container-title-short":"Int J Life Cycle Assess","DOI":"10.1007/s11367-013-0577-1","ISSN":"0948-3349, 1614-7502","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",7]]},"language":"en","license":"http://www.springer.com/tdm","number":"6","page":"1253-1264","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Land use impacts on freshwater regulation, erosion regulation, and water purification: a spatial approach for a global scale level","title-short":"Land use impacts on freshwater regulation, erosion regulation, and water purification","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11367-013-0577-1","volume":"18"},{"id":"Sabatini2021_sPlotOpenenvironmentally","abstract":"Motivation Assessing biodiversity status and trends in plant communities is critical for understanding, quantifying and predicting the effects of global change on ecosystems. Vegetation plots record the occurrence or abundance of all plant species co-occurring within delimited local areas. This allows species absences to be inferred, information seldom provided by existing global plant datasets. Although many vegetation plots have been recorded, most are not available to the global research community. A recent initiative, called ‘sPlot’, compiled the first global vegetation plot database, and continues to grow and curate it. The sPlot database, however, is extremely unbalanced spatially and environmentally, and is not open-access. Here, we address both these issues by (a) resampling the vegetation plots using several environmental variables as sampling strata and (b) securing permission from data holders of 105 local-to-regional datasets to openly release data. We thus present sPlotOpen, the largest open-access dataset of vegetation plots ever released. sPlotOpen can be used to explore global diversity at the plant community level, as ground truth data in remote sensing applications, or as a baseline for biodiversity monitoring. Main types of variable contained Vegetation plots (n = 95,104) recording cover or abundance of naturally co-occurring vascular plant species within delimited areas. sPlotOpen contains three partially overlapping resampled datasets (c. 50,000 plots each), to be used as replicates in global analyses.

Nevertheless, the ethical underpinnings of the case for assisted colonization are claims about the value of species. A complete discussion of assisted colonization needs to include assessment of these claims. For each type of value that species are thought to possess it is necessary to determine whether it is plausible that species possess the type of value and, if so, to what extent their possessing it justifies assisted colonization. I conducted such an assessment for each of the predominant types of value ascribed to species: ecological, instrumental (including option value), existence, and intrinsic value (including interest-based, objective, and valuer-dependent intrinsic value). The vast majority of species, including several that have been proposed as candidates for assisted colonization, have much less value than is often presumed. Moreover, with respect to some types of value, assisted colonization would not fully preserve the value of the target species even if it were to keep the target species in existence. Therefore, the case for assisted colonization is significantly weaker and more qualified than its advocates often suppose. There may be exceptional species for which assisted colonization is well justified—and for this reason, case-by-case assessment is necessary—but in general the burden of justification generated by the ecological risks associated with assisted colonization is not met by the value potentially preserved by assisted colonization. This suggests that assisted colonization ought to have, at most, a very minor role in the portfolio of ecosystem management practices, even as it pertains to species conservation under conditions of rapid climate change.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",7,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Sandler","given":"Ronald"}],"citation-key":"Sandler2010_ValueSpecies","container-title":"Conservation Biology","DOI":"10.1111/j.1523-1739.2009.01351.x","ISSN":"1523-1739","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010"]]},"language":"en","license":"©2009 Society for Conservation Biology","page":"424-431","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"The Value of Species and the Ethical Foundations of Assisted Colonization","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2009.01351.x","volume":"24"},{"id":"Sandler2012_IntrinsicValue","abstract":"Do non-human organisms, species, and ecosystems have intrinsic value i.e., value in themselves, for what they are, or as ends?

Although extensive information regarding the effect of CA on soil properties and microbiome is available, complete studies on the cumulative effect on specific interactions between soil parameters, crop productivity, and microbial communities over time are still lacking, mainly in arid regions. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the effects of no-tillage and residue retention over long- and short-term (24 and 3 years, respectively) periods. Six treatments were established in a maize–oat–triticale system from 1995 in a semiarid region: P + H—plow + harrow; H—harrow; MP—multi-plow (short-term); NT—no-tillage; NT33—NT + 33% residue surface cover (long-term); NT66—NT + 66% residue surface cover. Results indicated that CA improved soil quality by increasing soil organic matter (SOM), total carbon, and glomalin; it also enhanced microbial abundance, particularly fungi, and β-galactosidase activity. Nevertheless, conventional tillage practices led to SOM degradation and reduced crop yields. Principal component analysis revealed distinct groupings of treatments based on soil properties and microbial communities. Furthermore, changes could be detected from the short term. These findings highlight the importance of adopting sustainable agricultural practices to maintain soil health and ensure agricultural productivity in semi-arid regions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Santellanez-Arreola","given":"Kassandra"},{"family":"Martínez-Gamiño","given":"Miguel Ángel"},{"family":"Constante-García","given":"Vicenta"},{"family":"Arreola-Ávila","given":"Jesús"},{"family":"García-De la Peña","given":"Cristina"},{"family":"Siller-Rodríguez","given":"Quetzaly Karmy"},{"family":"Trejo-Calzada","given":"Ricardo"},{"family":"Nava-Reyna","given":"Erika"}],"citation-key":"Santellanez-Arreola2025_SoilHealth","container-title":"Diversity","DOI":"10.3390/d17020090","ISSN":"1424-2818","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",2]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"2","page":"90","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"Beyond Soil Health: The Microbial Implications of Conservation Agriculture","title-short":"Beyond Soil Health","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-2818/17/2/90","volume":"17"},{"id":"Santini2017_AssessingSuitability","abstract":"A large number of diversity metrics are available to study and monitor biodiversity, and their responses to biodiversity changes are not necessarily coherent with each other. The choice of biodiversity metrics may thus strongly affect our interpretation of biodiversity change and, hence, prioritization of resources for conservation. Therefore it is crucial to understand which metrics respond to certain changes, are the most sensitive to change, show consistent responses across different communities, detect early signals of species decline, and are insensitive to demographic stochasticity. Here we generated synthetic communities and simulated changes in their composition according to 9 scenarios of biodiversity change to investigate the behaviour of 12 biodiversity metrics. Metrics showed diverse abilities to detect changes under different scenarios. Sørensen similarity index, ar ithmetic and geometric mean abundance, and species and functional richness were the most sensitive to community changes. Sørensen similarity index, species richness and geometric abundance showed consistent responses across all simulated communities and scenarios. Sørensen similarity index and geometric mean abundance were able to detect early signals of species decline. Geometric mean abundance, and functional evenness under certain scenarios, had the greatest ability to distinguish directional trends from stochastic changes, but Sørensen similarity index and geometric mean abundance were the only indices to show consistent signals under all replicates and scenarios. Classic abundanceweighted heterogeneity indices (e.g. Shannon index) were insensitive to certain changes or showed misleading responses, and are therefore unsuitable for comparison of biological communities. We therefore suggest that separate metrics of species composition, richness, and abundance should be reported instead of (or in addition to) composite metrics like the Shannon index.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",4,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Santini","given":"Luca"},{"family":"Belmaker","given":"Jonathan"},{"family":"Costello","given":"Mark J."},{"family":"Pereira","given":"Henrique M."},{"family":"Rossberg","given":"Axel G."},{"family":"Schipper","given":"Aafke M."},{"family":"Ceaușu","given":"Silvia"},{"family":"Dornelas","given":"Maria"},{"family":"Hilbers","given":"Jelle P."},{"family":"Hortal","given":"Joaquin"},{"family":"Huijbregts","given":"Mark A.J."},{"family":"Navarro","given":"Laetitia M."},{"family":"Schiffers","given":"Katja H."},{"family":"Visconti","given":"Piero"},{"family":"Rondinini","given":"Carlo"}],"citation-key":"Santini2017_AssessingSuitability","container-title":"Biological Conservation","container-title-short":"Biological Conservation","DOI":"10.1016/j.biocon.2016.08.024","ISSN":"00063207","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",9]]},"language":"en","page":"341-350","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Assessing the suitability of diversity metrics to detect biodiversity change","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0006320716303305","volume":"213"},{"id":"Sanye-Mengual2023_Whatare","abstract":"Purpose Recent developments in life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) target at better addressing biodiversity impacts, including the extended modeling of drivers of biodiversity loss. This led to the development of multiple LCIA methods addressing the area of protection of ecosystem quality (i.e, biodiversity loss) over time. This paper aims at systematically comparing available operational LCIA methods and models for assessing the main drivers of biodiversity impacts of EU consumption and unveiling similarities and differences among current methods.\nMethods This paper compares the biodiversity impacts of EU consumption by implementing eight LCIA methods and models: five full LCIA methods (namely, LC-IMPACT, Impact World + , Ecological Scarcity 2013, ReCiPe 2016, and Stepwise), a land-use intensity-specific LCIA model, and two approaches based on the GLOBIO model. The EU Consumption Footprint model is adopted as case study. The comparative analysis between the assessed methods aimed at identifying convergent and divergent results regarding the drivers of biodiversity impacts of EU consumption. The analysis focused on four different levels: impact category, representative product (modeled consumed products), inventory process, and elementary flow. The agreement among the methods in defining an element as relevant was evaluated. Finally, gaps among methods were assessed in terms of coverage of impact categories and elementary flows.\nResults and discussion The analysis unveiled that there is a certain level of agreement among available LCIA methods and models regarding the most contributing impact categories and products to the overall biodiversity footprint due to EU consumption. Land use, climate change, and ecotoxicity had a major contribution to overall impacts, thereby highlighting their role as drivers of biodiversity loss. Biodiversity impacts were due to a limited number of consumed products, where food (meat), mobility, and household goods were identified as top contributors. Most contributing inventory processes and elementary flows were associated to most contributing representative products (e.g, animal feed). The relevance and presence of elementary flows in LCIA methods and models were heterogeneous for most of the impact categories.\nConclusions The results of this study highlight the importance of impact category coverage in the assessment of biodiversity impacts. Limited coverage of impact categories (e.g, methods limited to assess land use) might underestimate the impacts of other drivers of biodiversity loss, especially climate change and ecotoxicity. Further efforts are required to assess the effects of spatial regionalization and the inclusion of missing drivers, recently developed in LCIA.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Sanyé-Mengual","given":"Esther"},{"family":"Biganzoli","given":"Fabrizio"},{"family":"Valente","given":"Antonio"},{"family":"Pfister","given":"Stephan"},{"family":"Sala","given":"Serenella"}],"citation-key":"Sanye-Mengual2023_Whatare","container-title":"The International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment","container-title-short":"Int J Life Cycle Assess","DOI":"10.1007/s11367-023-02169-7","ISSN":"0948-3349, 1614-7502","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",9]]},"language":"en","number":"9","page":"1194-1210","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"What are the main environmental impacts and products contributing to the biodiversity footprint of EU consumption?

Assembly is theorised to be a selective process: whether or not certain species or network structures can persist is partly determined by local processes including habitat filtering and dynamical constraints. Consequently, local food web structure should reflect these processes.The goal of this study was to test evidence for these selective processes by comparing the structural properties of real food webs to the expected distribution given the metaweb. We were particularly interested in ecological dynamics; if the network properties commonly associated with dynamical stability are indeed the result of stability constraints, then they should deviate from expectation in the direction predicted by theory. To create a null expectation, we used the novel approach of randomly assembling model webs by drawing species and interactions from the empirical metaweb. The assembly model permitted colonisation and extinction, and required a consumer species to have at least one prey, but had no habitat type nor population dynamical constraints. Three datasets were used: (a) the marine Antarctic metaweb, with two local food webs; (b) the 50 lakes of the Adirondacks; and (c) the arthropod community from Florida Keys' classic defaunation experiment. Contrary to our expectations, we found that there were almost no differences between empirical webs and those resulting from the null assembly model. Few empirical food webs showed significant differences with network properties, motif representations and topological roles. Network properties associated with stability did not deviate from expectation in the direction predicted by theory. Our results suggest that—for the commonly used metrics we considered—local food web structure is not strongly influenced by dynamical nor habitat restrictions. Instead, the structure is inherited from the metaweb. This suggests that the network properties typically attributed as causes or consequences of ecological stability are instead a by-product of the assembly process (i.e. spandrels), and may potentially be too coarse to detect the true signal of dynamical constraint.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",5,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Saravia","given":"Leonardo A."},{"family":"Marina","given":"Tomás I."},{"family":"Kristensen","given":"Nadiah P."},{"family":"Troch","given":"Marleen De"},{"family":"Momo","given":"Fernando R."}],"citation-key":"Saravia2022_Ecologicalnetwork","container-title":"Journal of Animal Ecology","DOI":"10.1111/1365-2656.13652","ISSN":"1365-2656","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"630-642","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","source":"besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com","title":"Ecological network assembly: How the regional metaweb influences local food webs","title-short":"Ecological network assembly","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2656.13652","volume":"91"},{"id":"Saura2011_Networkanalysis","abstract":"Landscape networks and ecosystems worldwide are undergoing changes that may impact in different ways relevant ecological processes such as gene flow, pollination, or wildlife dispersal. A myriad of indices have been developed to characterize landscape patterns, but not all of them are equally suited to evaluate temporal changes in landscape connectivity as is increasingly needed for biodiversity monitoring and operational indicator delivery. Relevant advancements in this direction have been recently proposed based on graph theoretical methods to analyze landscape network connectivity and on the measurement of habitat availability at the landscape scale. Building from these developments, we modify a recent index and present the equivalent connected area (ECA) index, defined as the size of a single patch (maximally connected) that would provide the same probability of connectivity than the actual habitat pattern in the landscape. The temporal changes in ECA can be directly compared with the changes in total habitat area. This allows for additional and straightforward insights on the degree to which the gains or losses in habitat amount can be beneficial or deleterious by affecting landscape elements that uphold connectivity in a wider landscape context. We provide a demonstrative example of application and interpretation of this index and approach to monitor changes in functional landscape connectivity. We focus on the trends in European forests at the province level in the period 1990–2000 from Corine land cover data, considering both changes in the forest spatial pattern and in the average permeability of the landscape matrix. The degree of connectivity was rather stable over most of the study area, with a slight overall increase in forest connectivity in Europe. However, a few countries and regions concentrated remarkably high changes in the analyzed period, particularly those with a low forest cover. The species traits also affected the responses to landscape pattern changes, which were more prominent for those species with limited dispersal abilities. We conclude discussing the potential of this approach for consistent indicator delivery, as well as the limitations and possibilities of application to a variety of situations, for which the required quantitative tools are freely available as open source projects.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Saura","given":"Santiago"},{"family":"Estreguil","given":"Christine"},{"family":"Mouton","given":"Coralie"},{"family":"Rodríguez-Freire","given":"Mónica"}],"citation-key":"Saura2011_Networkanalysis","container-title":"Ecological Indicators","container-title-short":"Ecological Indicators","DOI":"10.1016/j.ecolind.2010.06.011","ISSN":"1470-160X","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",3,1]]},"number":"2","page":"407-416","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Network analysis to assess landscape connectivity trends: Application to European forests (1990–2000)","title-short":"Network analysis to assess landscape connectivity trends","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1470160X10001159","volume":"11"},{"id":"Scherer2020_CharacterizingLand","abstract":"Decision support tools such as life cycle assessment (LCA) increasingly aim to account for impacts on biodiversity.

Three functional diversity indices therein describe different aspects of functional diversity, namely richness, evenness, and divergence. Applying our framework to Germany as a proof of concept, we show significant losses in functional plant diversity when converting natural forests to agricultural land use. Consistently across different forests and agricultural systems, functional richness decreases steeply and functional divergence moderately upon occupation. In contrast, functional evenness exhibits opposite trends. The resulting characterization factors are likely to be representative of temperate regions. The framework is flexible and applicable to larger scales and other impact categories. As such, it facilitates harmonizing biodiversity impact assessments and better represents ecosystem functioning by incorporating functional diversity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Scherer","given":"Laura"},{"family":"Baren","given":"Sven A.","non-dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Bodegom","given":"Peter M.","non-dropping-particle":"van"}],"citation-key":"Scherer2020_CharacterizingLand","container-title":"Environmental Science & Technology","container-title-short":"Environ.

Here, we evaluated the changes in terrestrial biodiversity intactness, expressed by the mean species abundance (MSA) metric, resulting from three of the shared socio-economic pathways (SSPs) combined with different levels of climate change (according to representative concentration pathways [RCPs]): a future oriented towards sustainability (SSP1xRCP2.6), a future determined by a politically divided world (SSP3xRCP6.0) and a future with continued global dependency on fossil fuels (SSP5xRCP8.5). To this end, we first updated the GLOBIO model, which now runs at a spatial resolution of 10 arc-seconds ( 300 m), contains new modules for downscaling land use and for quantifying impacts of hunting in the tropics, and updated modules to quantify impacts of climate change, land use, habitat fragmentation and nitrogen pollution. We then used the updated model to project terrestrial biodiversity intactness from 2015 to 2050 as a function of land use and climate changes corresponding with the selected scenarios. We estimated a global area-weighted mean MSA of 0.56 for 2015. Biodiversity intactness declined in all three scenarios, yet the decline was smaller in the sustainability scenario (−0.02) than the regional rivalry and fossil-fuelled development scenarios (−0.06 and −0.05 respectively). We further found considerable variation in projected biodiversity change among different world regions, with large future losses particularly for sub-Saharan Africa. In some scenario-region combinations, we projected future biodiversity recovery due to reduced demands for agricultural land, yet this recovery was counteracted by increased impacts of other pressures (notably climate change and road disturbance). Effective measures to halt or reverse the decline of terrestrial biodiversity should not only reduce land demand (e.g. by increasing agricultural productivity and dietary changes) but also focus on reducing or mitigating the impacts of other pressures.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Schipper","given":"Aafke M."},{"family":"Hilbers","given":"Jelle P."},{"family":"Meijer","given":"Johan R."},{"family":"Antão","given":"Laura H."},{"family":"Benítez-López","given":"Ana"},{"family":"Jonge","given":"Melinda M.

This concept is increasingly used in ecological research, yet its formal definition and measurements are currently under discussion. As the overall behavior and consistency of functional diversity indices have not been described so far, the novice user risks choosing an inaccurate index or a set of redundant indices to represent functional diversity. In our study we closely examine functional diversity indices to clarify their accuracy, consistency, and independence. Following current theory, we categorize them into functional richness, evenness, or divergence indices. We considered existing indices as well as new indices developed in this study. The new indices aimed at remedying the weaknesses of currently used indices (e.g., by taking into account intraspecific variability). Using virtual data sets, we test (1) whether indices respond to community changes as expected from their category and (2) whether the indices within each category are consistent and independent of indices from other categories. We also test the accuracy of methods proposed for the use of categorical traits. Most classical functional richness indices either failed to describe functional richness or were correlated with functional divergence indices. We therefore recommend using the new functional richness indices that consider intraspecific variability and thus empty space in the functional niche space. In contrast, most functional evenness and divergence indices performed well with respect to all proposed tests. For categorical variables, we do not recommend blending discrete and real-valued traits (except for indices based on distance measures) since functional evenness and divergence have no transposable meaning for discrete traits. Nonetheless, species diversity indices can be applied to categorical traits (using trait levels instead of species) in order to describe functional richness and equitability.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Schleuter","given":"D."},{"family":"Daufresne","given":"M."},{"family":"Massol","given":"F."},{"family":"Argillier","given":"C."}],"citation-key":"Schleuter2010_usersguide","container-title":"Ecological Monographs","DOI":"10.1890/08-2225.1","ISSN":"1557-7015","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2010 by the Ecological Society of America","number":"3","page":"469-484","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"A user's guide to functional diversity indices","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1890/08-2225.1","volume":"80"},{"id":"Schmidt2008_DevelopmentLCIA","abstract":"The UNEP/SETAC life cycle initiative has recently proposed a framework for life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) of land use. Still, a lack of appropriate LCIA-methods for assessing land use impacts exist in life cycle assessment (LCA). Most existing methods are either too coarse-grained regarding the differentiation between different land use types (e.g. conventional farming versus organic farming), or they are too narrow regarding spatial coverage (e.g. only part of Europe). Therefore, the purpose of this article is to develop a method that overcomes these problems. A secondary goal is to develop a method for which it is possible to determine characterisation factors for any land use type in any region without the need for overwhelming data and data manipulation requirements. The developed method for LCIA of biodiversity focuses on species richness of vascular plants which can be determined from species–area curves. The category indicator is calculated as the multiplication of occupied area, the number of species affected per standard area (100m2), the duration of occupation and renaturalisation from transformation, and a factor for ecosystem vulnerability. The main uncertainties of the method are related to the determination of renaturalisation times and the establishment species–area curves. The intention of the study presented in this article, i.e. to develop an applicable model with global coverage and no constraints on resolution regarding spatial and land use type differentiation, has widely been met. The limiting factor for applicability is the access to species richness surveys for the relevant regions and land use types.

This paper presents the conceptual framework required for a consistent modelling of iLUC in Life Cycle Assessment. It reports on a novel and biophysical iLUC model, in which amortisation is avoided by using discounted Global Warming Potentials (GWPs). The causal link between demand for land and land use changes is established through markets for land's production capacity.

In biogeography, this problem is addressed by analyzing observations of species under various environmental conditions. In recent decades, large amounts of data on the occurrence of species have been made available in open databases (e.g. GBIF) along with environmental data describing climate, land use and soil conditions, etc. All this provides a breeding ground for the development of statistical methods and computer tools applied to biodiversity data mining in order to (1) understand the factors that determine the observed distribution of living organisms; in order to (2) predict their response to changing environmental conditions. This thesis falls within this interdisciplinary context. By adopting the community assembly and ecological niche theories as conceptual framework, we present a methodological framework for the analysis of multi-species occurrence data. Next, we illustrate its usefulness via three concrete applications. First, we address the problem of recommending species according to geographical location, applied to vegetation data from the Pl@ntNet mobile app. We evaluate two alternative architectures enabled by our framework for this task: a convolutional neural network applied to environmental rasters only, and a species embedding architecture applied to animal occurrences. Second, we presented a novel framework for ecological association inference from co-abundance that supports asymmetric and bidirectional associations via a response-effect decomposition of dependency networks. We evaluated the proposal in comparison to state of art network inference methods on a simulation experiment. Then, we applied it to the analysis of potential interactions between alpine plants on a meso-topographic gradient of snow cover duration. Third, we extended joint species distribution models to support rich features and non-linear responses using multi-task neural networks with latent variables to model species associations. We applied the model to the study of French earthworms and their associations, as well as to the prediction of the geographical distribution of earthworm diversity in France.

In this study, for the first time, we demonstrate mapping of the relative abundance of the soil microbiome for three terrestrial ecosystems across North America (savanna, boreal and tundra) using airborne image spectroscopy and environmental DNA (eDNA) data. We identified field plots of publicly available eDNA data co-occurring with AVIRIS-NG hyperspectral imagery. An eDNA processing pipeline was developed to generate a consistent profile of the relative abundance for thousands of microbiome operational taxonomic units (OTU) and 225 microbiome families. Using Linear Discriminate Analysis (LDA) scores for the eDNA data, we identified 81 families with the greatest explanatory power based on the community composition between the three ecosystems. A case study example demonstrates our conceptual approach by selecting a dominant and functionally important bacterial family for each ecosystem, with each family representing a specific biomarker. A partial least squares regression (PLSR) was applied to spatially predict the relative abundance of each bacteria family (in the boreal, tundra, and savanna ecosystems) from the hyperspectral imagery. For the boreal, Pseudomonadaceae is shown to be a dominant family taxon, as it is a saprophytic family specialized in decomposing the dense organic matter of boreal forest soils.

Here we describe a fundamentally different approach to alpha biodiversity modelling, by coupling remote sensing image spectroscopy from the DESIS satellite with eDNA profiling using Gaussian Process Regression. Alpha diversity is mapped at a fine resolution of 30 m, and expressed using metrics including functional richness, Shannon index as well as phylogenetic diversity. Up to 50% variance in bacterial alpha diversity, and 40% of fungal alpha diversity variance, are explained by our modelling. Further, we demonstrated how ecological relations are signalled by the microbiological communities, in three European temperate forests. Our findings demonstrated for the first time using the combination of eDNA and image spectroscopy, that key ecological variables relate to alpha diversity, thereby accelerating our understanding of the spatial variation in bacterial and fungal communities across large and complex forest landscapes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",5,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Skidmore","given":"Andrew K."},{"family":"Abdullah","given":"Haidi"},{"family":"Siegenthaler","given":"Andjin"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Tiejun"},{"family":"Adiningrat","given":"Devara P."},{"family":"Rousseau","given":"Mélody"},{"family":"Duan","given":"Yiwei"},{"family":"Torres-Rodriguez","given":"Alejandra"},{"family":"Heurich","given":"Marco"},{"family":"Chariton","given":"Anthony A."},{"family":"Darvishzadeh","given":"Roshanak"},{"family":"Neinavaz","given":"Elnaz"},{"family":"De Groot","given":"G.

Characterization factors are provided as global raster data sets at high spatial resolution (∼1 km) and for larger geographic units including uncertainties of spatial aggregation. Uncertainties due to variability of climate and weather are provided where possible. The application of the methods is demonstrated and discussed in a simplified case study.

Two key microbial mechanisms that can support microbiome stability include dormancy and dispersal. Specifically, microbial populations that are sensitive to disturbance can be re-seeded by local dormant pools of viable and reactivated cells, or by immigrants dispersed from regional metacommunities. However, it is difficult to quantify the contributions of these mechanisms to stability without, first, distinguishing the active from inactive membership, and, second, distinguishing the populations recovered by local resuscitation from those recovered by dispersed immigrants. Here, we investigate the contributions of dormancy dynamics (activation and inactivation), and dispersal to soil microbial community resistance and resilience. We designed a replicated, 45-week time-series experiment to quantify the responses of the active soil microbial community to a thermal press disturbance, including unwarmed control mesocosms, disturbed mesocosms without dispersal, and disturbed mesocosms with dispersal after the release of the stressor. Communities changed in structure within one week of warming. Though the disturbed mesocosms did not fully recover within 29 weeks, resuscitation of thermotolerant taxa was key for community transition during the press, and both resuscitation of opportunistic taxa and immigration contributed to community resilience. Also, mesocosms with dispersal were more resilient than mesocosms without. This work advances the mechanistic understanding of how microbiomes respond to disturbances in their environment.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",6,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Sorensen","given":"Jackson W."},{"family":"Shade","given":"Ashley"}],"citation-key":"Sorensen2020_DormancyDynamics","container-title":"Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","DOI":"10.1098/rstb.2019.0255","issue":"1798","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",3,23]]},"page":"20190255","publisher":"Royal Society","source":"royalsocietypublishing.org (Atypon)","title":"Dormancy dynamics and dispersal contribute to soil microbiome resilience","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2019.0255","volume":"375"},{"id":"Soule1985_WhatConservation","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",6,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Soulé","given":"Michael E."}],"citation-key":"Soule1985_WhatConservation","container-title":"BioScience","DOI":"10.2307/1310054","ISSN":"0006-3568","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["1985"]]},"page":"727-734","publisher":"[American Institute of Biological Sciences, Oxford University Press]","source":"JSTOR","title":"What Is Conservation Biology?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/1310054","volume":"35"},{"id":"Soule2023_predictiveindicator","abstract":"Biodiversity is a key component of agricultural ecosystems and belongs to one of the exceeded planetary boundaries. In the quest for innovation to mitigate impact, it is essential to have tools to assess the anthropogenic impact on biodiversity. In this study, we developed a new indicator, I-BIO that aimed to predict the impacts of management practices and the influence of the landscape on overall biodiversity at species group level. I-BIO encompassed four groups: microorganisms, vegetation, invertebrates and vertebrates. This predictive indicator was built using DEXi software that facilitates the design of hierarchical decision trees, based on input variables in the form of qualitative classes, aggregated using utility functions. I-BIO was constructed using data from a long-term platform in Scotland and then applied to two data sets in France and one in Scotland. The results showed that the lowest class is predominant for all branches especially for invertebrates and soil invertebrates. Monte Carlo sampling was used to test for sensitivity. Then, a validation step was carried out to compare I-BIO outputs with real data using data on the four groups from Scottish and French datasets. I-BIO predictions of weed and soil invertebrate abundance conformed to field data. Due to low numbers of samples, validation of microorganisms, flying invertebrates and vertebrates predictions require more data. Future developments of I-BIO will focus on predictions specifically to assess the impact of management on species richness.

In total, 5000+ Characterisation Factors for exploited marine organisms have been re-computed with updated fisheries production data (2018), exploring temporal effects on dynamic, biotic resource impacts. An estimation of discarded unwanted by-catch is incorporated into the characterisation. Regional to global scaling factors are tested for the representation of species-specific vulnerability. The temporal and spatial variations in impacts reflect the dynamic nature of real-world fisheries trends, global average impacts increased by 41% (2015–2018). Discarding as an additive, regional estimate increases impacts, most notably for lower impacted stocks. The retention of species-specific detail relating to species distributions is of particular relevance to fisheries when computing global-scale impacts. Updating CFs improves the relevance of the fisheries impact assessment, and continued periodic re-computation is recommended to maintain relevance with real-world trends.

There is a strong methodological shortage to integrate the impact of anthropogenic pressure on the soil system within large scale environmental frameworks, such as the Life Cycle Assessment. The LANCA® method was proposed to meet this need, integrating five impact categories of soil functions and directly applicable within the Life Cycle Assessment framework. Although the most recent 2016-LANCA® version shows readiness to be integrated in this large scale environmental framework to meet the demand, it has not yet been applied and validated on case studies. This study proposes a first application of the LANCA® model on two contrasted agricultural-based case studies to share experience in implementing the model through both background and foreground approaches, to analyze the first model outputs and to provide tracks for further model improvements.

Agricultural intensification is known to change the diversity of individual groups of soil biota, but less is known about how intensification affects biodiversity of the soil food web as a whole, and whether or not these effects may be generalized across regions. We examined biodiversity in soil food webs from grasslands, extensive, and intensive rotations in four agricultural regions across Europe: in Sweden, the UK, the Czech Republic and Greece. Effects of land-use intensity were quantified based on structure and diversity among functional groups in the soil food web, as well as on community-weighted mean body mass of soil fauna. We also elucidate land-use intensity effects on diversity of taxonomic units within taxonomic groups of soil fauna. We found that between regions soil food web diversity measures were variable, but that increasing land-use intensity caused highly consistent responses. In particular, land-use intensification reduced the complexity in the soil food webs, as well as the community-weighted mean body mass of soil fauna. In all regions across Europe, species richness of earthworms, Collembolans, and oribatid mites was negatively affected by increased land-use intensity. The taxonomic distinctness, which is a measure of taxonomic relatedness of species in a community that is independent of species richness, was also reduced by land-use intensification. We conclude that intensive agriculture reduces soil biodiversity, making soil food webs less diverse and composed of smaller bodied organisms. Land-use intensification results in fewer functional groups of soil biota with fewer and taxonomically more closely related species. We discuss how these changes in soil biodiversity due to land-use intensification may threaten the functioning of soil in agricultural production systems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",5,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Tsiafouli","given":"Maria A."},{"family":"Thébault","given":"Elisa"},{"family":"Sgardelis","given":"Stefanos P."},{"family":"Ruiter","given":"Peter C.","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Putten","given":"Wim H.","non-dropping-particle":"van der"},{"family":"Birkhofer","given":"Klaus"},{"family":"Hemerik","given":"Lia"},{"family":"Vries","given":"Franciska T.","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Bardgett","given":"Richard D."},{"family":"Brady","given":"Mark Vincent"},{"family":"Bjornlund","given":"Lisa"},{"family":"Jørgensen","given":"Helene Bracht"},{"family":"Christensen","given":"Sören"},{"family":"Hertefeldt","given":"Tina D’"},{"family":"Hotes","given":"Stefan"},{"family":"Gera Hol","given":"W.h."},{"family":"Frouz","given":"Jan"},{"family":"Liiri","given":"Mira"},{"family":"Mortimer","given":"Simon R."},{"family":"Setälä","given":"Heikki"},{"family":"Tzanopoulos","given":"Joseph"},{"family":"Uteseny","given":"Karoline"},{"family":"Pižl","given":"Václav"},{"family":"Stary","given":"Josef"},{"family":"Wolters","given":"Volkmar"},{"family":"Hedlund","given":"Katarina"}],"citation-key":"Tsiafouli2015_Intensiveagriculture","container-title":"Global Change Biology","DOI":"10.1111/gcb.12752","ISSN":"1365-2486","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","page":"973-985","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Intensive agriculture reduces soil biodiversity across Europe","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gcb.12752","volume":"21"},{"id":"Tuanmu2014_global1km","abstract":"Aim For many applications in biodiversity and ecology, existing remote sensing-derived land-cover products have limitations due to among-product inconsistency and their typically non-continuous nature. Here we aim to help address these shortcomings by generating a 1-km resolution global product that provides scale-integrated and accuracy-weighted consensus land-cover information on an approximately continuous scale. Location Global. Methods Using a generalized classification scheme and an accuracy-based integration approach, we integrated four global land-cover products. We evaluated the performance of this product compared with inputs for estimating subpixel 30-m resolution land cover. We also compared the accuracy of deductive and inductive species distribution models built with the different products for modelling the continental distributions of six avian habitat specialists. Results Our product offers accuracy-weighted consensus information on the prevalence of 12 land-cover classes within every nominal 1-km pixel across the globe (except for Antarctica). Compared with the four base products, it better captures the land-cover information contained in the fine-grain validation data for all classes combined and for most individual classes. It also has the highest sensitivity and overall accuracy for detecting the presence of every fine-grain land-cover class. Both deductive and inductive models built with the consensus dataset have the highest or second highest accuracy for modelling bird species distributions. Main conclusions Our consensus product integrates the four base products and successfully maximizes accuracy and reduces errors of omission. Specifically, the consensus product reduces limitations caused by misclassifications, false absence rates and the categorical format of existing land-cover products. Consequently, it surpasses single base products in the ability to capture subpixel land-cover information and the utility for modelling species distributions. Both the presented methodology and the consensus product have multiple applications in biodiversity research and for understanding and modelling of global terrestrial ecosystems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",4,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Tuanmu","given":"Mao-Ning"},{"family":"Jetz","given":"Walter"}],"citation-key":"Tuanmu2014_global1km","container-title":"Global Ecology and Biogeography","DOI":"10.1111/geb.12182","ISSN":"1466-8238","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","page":"1031-1045","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"A global 1-km consensus land-cover product for biodiversity and ecosystem modelling","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/geb.12182","volume":"23"},{"id":"Tuck2014_Landuseintensity","abstract":"The benefits of organic farming to biodiversity in agricultural landscapes continue to be hotly debated, emphasizing the importance of precisely quantifying the effect of organic vs. conventional farming. We conducted an updated hierarchical meta-analysis of studies that compared biodiversity under organic and conventional farming methods, measured as species richness. We calculated effect sizes for 184 observations garnered from 94 studies, and for each study, we obtained three standardized measures reflecting land-use intensity. We investigated the stability of effect sizes through time, publication bias due to the ‘file drawer’ problem, and consider whether the current literature is representative of global organic farming patterns. On average, organic farming increased species richness by about 30%. This result has been robust over the last 30 years of published studies and shows no sign of diminishing. Organic farming had a greater effect on biodiversity as the percentage of the landscape consisting of arable fields increased, that is, it is higher in intensively farmed regions. The average effect size and the response to agricultural intensification depend on taxonomic group, functional group and crop type. There is some evidence for publication bias in the literature; however, our results are robust to its impact. Current studies are heavily biased towards northern and western Europe and North America, while other regions with large areas of organic farming remain poorly investigated. Synthesis and applications. Our analysis affirms that organic farming has large positive effects on biodiversity compared with conventional farming, but that the effect size varies with the organism group and crop studied, and is greater in landscapes with higher land-use intensity. Decisions about where to site organic farms to maximize biodiversity will, however, depend on the costs as well as the potential benefits. Current studies have been heavily biased towards agricultural systems in the developed world. We recommend that future studies pay greater attention to other regions, in particular, areas with tropical, subtropical and Mediterranean climates, in which very few studies have been conducted.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",5,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Tuck","given":"Sean L."},{"family":"Winqvist","given":"Camilla"},{"family":"Mota","given":"Flávia"},{"family":"Ahnström","given":"Johan"},{"family":"Turnbull","given":"Lindsay A."},{"family":"Bengtsson","given":"Janne"}],"citation-key":"Tuck2014_Landuseintensity","container-title":"Journal of Applied Ecology","DOI":"10.1111/1365-2664.12219","ISSN":"1365-2664","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2013 The Authors.

The CLUMondo model provides an innovative approach for global land-use change modeling to support integrated assessments. Demands for goods and services are, in the model, supplied by a variety of land systems that are characterized by their land cover mosaic, the agricultural management intensity, and livestock. Land system changes are simulated by the model, driven by regional demand for goods and influenced by local factors that either constrain or promote land system conversion. A characteristic of the new model is the endogenous simulation of intensification of agricultural management versus expansion of arable land, and urban versus rural settlements expansion based on land availability in the neighborhood of the location. Model results for the OECD Environmental Outlook scenario show that allocation of increased agricultural production by either management intensification or area expansion varies both among and within world regions, providing useful insight into the land sparing versus land sharing debate. The land system approach allows the inclusion of different types of demand for goods and services from the land system as a driving factor of land system change.

Earthworms are among the most important soil dwelling invertebrates. Their activity affects both biotic and abiotic soil properties, in turn affecting plant growth. Yet, studies on the effect of earthworm presence on crop yields have not been quantitatively synthesized. Here we show, using meta-analysis, that on average earthworm presence in agroecosystems leads to a 25% increase in crop yield and a 23% increase in aboveground biomass. The magnitude of these effects depends on presence of crop residue, earthworm density and type and rate of fertilization. The positive effects of earthworms become larger when more residue is returned to the soil, but disappear when soil nitrogen availability is high. This suggests that earthworms stimulate plant growth predominantly through releasing nitrogen locked away in residue and soil organic matter. Our results therefore imply that earthworms are of crucial importance to decrease the yield gap of farmers who can't -or won't- use nitrogen fertilizer.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",4,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Groenigen","given":"Jan Willem","non-dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Lubbers","given":"Ingrid M."},{"family":"Vos","given":"Hannah M.

However, at the most general level, patterns in the composition and diversity of species—the subject matter of community ecology—are influenced by only four classes of process: selection, drift, speciation, and dispersal. Selection represents deterministic fitness differences among species, drift represents stochastic changes in species abundance, speciation creates new species, and dispersal is the movement of organisms across space. All theoretical and conceptual models in community ecology can be understood with respect to their emphasis on these four processes. Empirical evidence exists for all of these processes and many of their interactions, with a predominance of studies on selection. Organizing the material of community ecology according to this framework can clarify the essential similarities and differences among the many conceptual and theoretical approaches to the discipline, and it can also allow for the articulation of a very general theory of community dynamics: species are added to communities via speciation and dispersal, and the relative abundances of these species are then shaped by drift and selection, as well as ongoing dispersal, to drive community dynamics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",5,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Vellend","given":"Mark"}],"citation-key":"Vellend2010_ConceptualSynthesis","container-title":"The Quarterly Review of Biology","container-title-short":"The Quarterly Review of Biology","DOI":"10.1086/652373","ISSN":"0033-5770, 1539-7718","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",6]]},"language":"en","page":"183-206","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Conceptual Synthesis in Community Ecology","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/652373","volume":"85"},{"id":"Vellend2013_GlobalMetaanalysis","abstract":"Global biodiversity is in decline.

We propose four different options for aggregating impacts across taxa and stressors: equal weight for species, equal weight for taxa and two options with special consideration of species’ vulnerability. We apply the aggregation options to a case study of coffee, tea and sugarcane production in Kenya for the production of 1 kg of crop. The ranking between stressors (land vs water use) within each crop and also of the overall impact between crops (coffee > sugarcane > tea) remained the same when applying the different aggregation options.

However, many of these advancements are scattered throughout the scientific literature, making it difficult for practitioners to apply the new models. Here, we present the LC-IMPACT method that provides characterization factors at the damage level for 11 impact categories related to three areas of protection (human health, ecosystem quality, natural resources). Human health damage is quantified as disability adjusted life years, damage to ecosystem quality as global species extinction equivalents (based on potentially disappeared fraction of species), and damage to mineral resources as kilogram of extra ore extracted. Seven of the impact categories include spatial differentiation at various levels of spatial scale. The influence of value choices related to the time horizon and the level of scientific evidence of the impacts considered is quantified with four distinct sets of characterization factors. We demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method with an illustrative life cycle assessment example of different fuel options in Europe (petrol or biofuel). Differences between generic and regionalized impacts vary up to two orders of magnitude for some of the selected impact categories, highlighting the importance of spatial detail in LCIA.

The Global Life Cycle Impact Assessment Method (GLAM) project of the Life Cycle Initiative hosted by the UN Environment Programme aims at making recommendations for new impact assessment models (such as for land use, water consumption and eutrophication) and improving the consistency and comparability across impact categories. An important aspect to ensure the comparability of these categories across geographic regions is to identify and quantify the scale of impacts, i.e., distinguish if an impact to an area results in local species losses or global species extinctions. This distinction is of high relevance because a species lost at a local level may still exist in other regions of the world and could potentially reestablish in that area, whereas global extinctions are irreversible. A consistent approach to scale impacts from local to global scales is currently not implemented within the LCIA framework, but is crucial to appropriately consider potential biodiversity impacts across impact categories. Here we present an updated approach for calculating a scaling factor, called the Global Extinction Probability (GEP), and calculate it for more than 98 000 species in 20 species groups across marine, terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems. We also provide the GEPs for different spatial scales, such as grid cells, ecoregions or watersheds and country averages. We found that GEP varies over orders of magnitude across the world, emphasizing the relevance of considering the spatial dimension of such extinction probabilities. We recommend quantifying global extinctions based on local species loss by multiplying local species loss within a certain spatial unit with the GEP corresponding to the same spatial unit. GEPs harmonize the quantification of biodiversity impacts across impact categories, improving information to support environmental decision-making.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Verones","given":"Francesca"},{"family":"Kuipers","given":"Koen J.

In the last 15 years, substantial efforts have been made to quantify the impacts on soils derived from production systems and their related supply chains. In this study, a systematic, qualitative evaluation of up-to-date models connecting land occupation and land transformation to soil impact indicators (e.g., soil properties, functions, and threats) is performed. The focus is on models that may be applied for assessing supply chains, namely in the context of life cycle assessment (LCA). A range of eleven soil-related models was selected and evaluated against different criteria, including scientiﬁc soundness, stakeholders' acceptance, reproducibility, and the applicability of models from the perspective of LCA practitioners. Additionally, this study proposes a new land use cause-effect chain to qualify the impacts of land use on soils. None of the models is fulﬁlling all the criteria and includes comprehensively the cause-effect impact pathways. Notably, trade-offs were most frequent between the relevance of the modeled impact processes and the models' applicability. On the one hand, models proposing multi-indicators cover several drivers of impacts and have a broader scope. On the other hand, several models just focus on one driver of impact, but may provide more relevant impact characterization. Our results provide common ground for the development and identiﬁcation of models that provide a comprehensive and robust assessment of land use change and land use impacts on soils. Indeed, to ensure both a comprehensive and relevant characterization of impacts, the study identiﬁes several research needs for further models' developments, namely: 1) adopting a common land use cause-effect chain and land use classiﬁcation; 2) accounting for different land management and land use intensities; 3) expanding the inventory data beyond the accounting of the area related to a certain land use; 4) assessing the added value of multi-indicators compared to single indicators, including the reduction of possible redundancies in the impact evaluation; 5) improving consistency from midpoint to endpoint characterization, especially the link with biodiversity; 6) guiding the calculation of normalization factors; and 7) assessing systematically model's uncertainty.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Vidal-Legaz","given":"Beatriz"},{"family":"Maia De Souza","given":"Danielle"},{"family":"Teixeira","given":"Ricardo F.

Various indices have been proposed to measure the functional diversity of a community, but there is still no consensus on which are most suitable. Indeed, none of the existing indices meets all the criteria required for general use. The main criteria are that they must be designed to deal with several traits, take into account abundances, and measure all the facets of functional diversity. Here we propose three indices to quantify each facet of functional diversity for a community with species distributed in a multidimensional functional space: functional richness (volume of the functional space occupied by the community), functional evenness (regularity of the distribution of abundance in this volume), and functional divergence (divergence in the distribution of abundance in this volume). Functional richness is estimated using the existing convex hull volume index. The new functional evenness index is based on the minimum spanning tree which links all the species in the multidimensional functional space. Then this new index quantifies the regularity with which species abundances are distributed along the spanning tree. Functional divergence is measured using a novel index which quantifies how species diverge in their distances (weighted by their abundance) from the center of gravity in the functional space. We show that none of the indices meets all the criteria required for a functional diversity index, but instead we show that the set of three complementary indices meets these criteria. Through simulations of artificial data sets, we demonstrate that functional divergence and functional evenness are independent of species richness and that the three functional diversity indices are independent of each other. Overall, our study suggests that decomposition of functional diversity into its three primary components provides a meaningful framework for its quantification and for the classification of existing functional diversity indices. This decomposition has the potential to shed light on the role of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning and on the influence of biotic and abiotic filters on the structure of species communities. Finally, we propose a general framework for applying these three functional diversity indices.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Villéger","given":"Sébastien"},{"family":"Mason","given":"Norman W.

Over the last three decades, developments in community and ecosystem ecology have forced the concept of trait beyond these original boundaries, and trait-based approaches are now widely used in studies ranging from the level of organisms to that of ecosystems. Despite some attempts to fix the terminology, especially in plant ecology, there is currently a high degree of confusion in the use, not only of the term “trait” itself, but also in the underlying concepts it refers to. We therefore give an unambiguous definition of plant trait, with a particular emphasis on functional trait. A hierarchical perspective is proposed, extending the “performance paradigm” to plant ecology. “Functional traits” are defined as morpho-physio-phenological traits which impact fitness indirectly via their effects on growth, reproduction and survival, the three components of individual performance. We finally present an integrative framework explaining how changes in trait values due to environmental variations are translated into organismal performance, and how these changes may influence processes at higher organizational levels. We argue that this can be achieved by developing “integration functions” which can be grouped into functional response (community level) and effect (ecosystem level) algorithms.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",5,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Violle","given":"Cyrille"},{"family":"Navas","given":"Marie-Laure"},{"family":"Vile","given":"Denis"},{"family":"Kazakou","given":"Elena"},{"family":"Fortunel","given":"Claire"},{"family":"Hummel","given":"Irène"},{"family":"Garnier","given":"Eric"}],"citation-key":"Violle2007_Letconcept","container-title":"Oikos","DOI":"10.1111/j.0030-1299.2007.15559.x","ISSN":"1600-0706","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",5,1]]},"language":"en","page":"882-892","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","source":"nsojournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com","title":"Let the concept of trait be functional!","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://nsojournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.0030-1299.2007.15559.x","volume":"116"},{"id":"Vos2019_Largevariations","abstract":"Phosphorus (P) is an important nutrient for plant growth. However, P is often poorly available for uptake by roots because it strongly adsorbs to the soil mineral phase. Recent research shows that earthworms can temporally and locally increase P availability to plants. However, the pathways through which they do so are not fully understood, and it remains unclear to what extent this capacity varies among earthworm species. Here we study the variation among earthworm species with respect to readily-available P in casts as well as other physico-chemical cast properties, in a greenhouse pot experiment using a soil with a low P status. The earthworms belong to eight commonly occurring earthworm species in the Netherlands: two epigeic species (a mixture of the compost earthworms Dendrobaena veneta/Eisenia fetida; Lumbricus rubellus); four endogeic species (Allolobophora chlorotica, Aporrectodea caliginosa, Aporrectodea rosea, Octolasion lacteum); and two anecic species (Aporrectodea longa; Lumbricus terrestris). For all species, the pH in water extracts of earthworm cast (pH = 7.4–8.2) was significantly higher (p < 0.001) than for the control bulk soil (pH = 6.6) and differed significantly (p = 0.003) among earthworm species. Similarly, the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration in the same water extracts was an order of magnitude higher in earthworm cast compared to the control bulk soil and varied among species (p < 0.001). The size of the total pool of reversibly adsorbed P in earthworm cast was greater than in the control bulk soil, but no significant differences were found among earthworm species. Differences among species were present for the readily-available P pools extracted from casts, including P-Olsen and water-extractable ortho-P. Water-extractable ortho-P concentrations were much higher in the casts of all species as compared to the control bulk soil (0.9–6.8 vs 0.06 mg l−1 or to 9.0–68 vs 0.6 mg kg−1). Highest ortho-P levels were measured in L. rubellus casts and the lowest in casts of A. chlorotica. A positive correlation between the concentrations of DOC and ortho-P was observed (R2 = 0.72, p < 0.001). The observed variation in all measured physico-chemical cast properties could not be explained by conventional ecological earthworm classifications. Our results show that the nature and magnitude of earthworm-induced increased P availability differs dramatically among earthworm species. This strongly suggests that, apart from its size, species composition of the earthworm community is key to optimizing P availability to plants.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",3,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Vos","given":"Hannah M.

To address this knowledge gap, the contents of fungal and bacterial necromass were estimated based on glucosamine and muramic acid contents in cropland (986 samples), grassland (278 samples), and forest (452 samples) soils. On an average, microbial necromass C contributed 51%, 47%, and 35% to the SOC in cropland, grassland, and forest soils, respectively, in the first 20 cm of topsoil. The contribution of microbial necromass to SOC increased with soil depth in grasslands (from 47% to 54%) and forests (from 34% to 44%), while it decreased in croplands (from 51% to 24%). The microbial necromass accumulation coefficient (the ratio between necromass and living microbial biomass C) was higher in soil from croplands (41) and grasslands (33) than in forest (20) soils. These results suggest that the turnover of living microbial biomass is faster in grassland and cropland soils than in forest soils, where the latter contains more partially decomposed plant residues. Fungal necromass C (>65% of total necromass) had consistently higher contributions to SOC than bacterial necromass C (32–36%) in all soils due to i) a larger living fungal biomass than bacterial biomass, and ii) fungal cell compounds being decomposed slowly and, thus able to persist longer in soil. The ratio of fungal:bacterial necromass C increased from 2.4 to 2.9 in the order of croplands < grasslands < forests, because fungi are the principal decomposers of complex substrates dominant in grassland and, especially, in forest soils. The ratios of bacterial:microbial necromass and bacterial:fungal necromass in cropland soils are larger than those in grassland and forest soils. This result indicates that the relative contribution of fungal necromass to total microbial necromass is lowest in cropland among the three land uses. Moreover, fungal and bacterial necromass increased with the total living microbial C and N contents. Lower temperatures and soil pH (e.g., in temperate and boreal ecosystems) stimulate fungal and bacterial necromass accumulation. These findings highlight the fact that shifts in the bacterial:fungal necromass ratio and the microbial necromass contribution to SOC are ecosystem-specific and depend on climate. In conclusion, microbial necromass contributes to approximately half of the SOC in cropland and grassland soils, and only 35% in forest soils; whereas, two-thirds of microbial necromass are of fungal origin.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",4,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Baorong"},{"family":"An","given":"Shaoshan"},{"family":"Liang","given":"Chao"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Yang"},{"family":"Kuzyakov","given":"Yakov"}],"citation-key":"Wang2021_MicrobialNecromass","container-title":"Soil Biology and Biochemistry","container-title-short":"Soil Biology and Biochemistry","DOI":"10.1016/j.soilbio.2021.108422","ISSN":"0038-0717","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",11,1]]},"page":"108422","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Microbial necromass as the source of soil organic carbon in global ecosystems","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038071721002960","volume":"162"},{"id":"Wasserstein2019_MovingWorld","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",5,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Wasserstein","given":"Ronald L."},{"family":"","given":"Schirm ,Allen L."},{"family":"Lazar","given":"Nicole A.","non-dropping-particle":"and"}],"citation-key":"Wasserstein2019_MovingWorld","container-title":"The American Statistician","DOI":"10.1080/00031305.2019.1583913","ISSN":"0003-1305","issue":"sup1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",3,29]]},"page":"1-19","publisher":"ASA Website","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Moving to a World Beyond “p < 0.05”","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/00031305.2019.1583913","volume":"73"},{"id":"Wei2016_UsingReliability","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Wei","given":"Wei"},{"family":"Larrey-Lassalle","given":"Pyrène"},{"family":"Faure","given":"Thierry"},{"family":"Dumoulin","given":"Nicolas"},{"family":"Roux","given":"Philippe"},{"family":"Mathias","given":"Jean-Denis"}],"citation-key":"Wei2016_UsingReliability","container-title":"Environmental Science & Technology","container-title-short":"Environ.

Published LCA studies rarely specify and justify their modelling choices. Since LCA studies are typically performed within the context of social responsibility and product life cycle management, this article investigates the relationship between social responsibility paradigms and the system modelling choices in LCA. We identify three different social responsibility paradigms: Value chain responsibility, Supply chain responsibility and Consequential responsibility. We point out that while there is no generally right or wrong choice of system model, each responsibility paradigm implies a speciﬁc matching system model. We then argue that all responsibility paradigms ultimately imply a consequential perspective, namely that of responding to the concerns of the system stakeholders. Although value or supply chains are systems deﬁned without concern for consequences, and thus may include activities that the decision maker cannot inﬂuence, the chosen system is still analysed and assessed by accounting for its social consequences, and it is for these consequences that social responsibility is then taken. We argue that it is inconsistent to exclude consequences of own actions (i.e. the consequential system) while including consequences from actions of others in value chain or supply chain. We thus conclude that a consistent socially responsible decisionmaker must always take responsibility for the activities in the consequential product life cycle and may additionally take responsibility for the consequences of other activities in the value chain or supply chain. We end the article with recommendations on reporting on LCA system models that are more speciﬁc than those of the current LCA standards.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",3,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Weidema","given":"Bo P."},{"family":"Pizzol","given":"Massimo"},{"family":"Schmidt","given":"Jannick"},{"family":"Thoma","given":"Greg"}],"citation-key":"Weidema2018_Attributionalconsequential","container-title":"Journal of Cleaner Production","container-title-short":"Journal of Cleaner Production","DOI":"10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.10.340","ISSN":"09596526","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",2]]},"language":"en","page":"305-314","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Attributional or consequential Life Cycle Assessment: A matter of social responsibility","title-short":"Attributional or consequential Life Cycle Assessment","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0959652617325829","volume":"174"},{"id":"Weinbauer2007_ExtinctionMicrobes","abstract":"Microbes, i.e. viruses, prokaryotes, protists and fungi are main players in biogeochemical cycles in aquatic and soil systems.

However, we summarize evidence that even free-living microbes have biogeographies and thus might be subject to at least local extinctions. Furthermore, some microbes do seem to be restricted to very particular environments and are endangered in as much as these environments are threatened. Finally, microbes intimately associated with other organisms share (partially) the biogeographies of their hosts. As far as they are species-specific, they could potentially become extinct along with their hosts. Overall, extinction rates typically reported are underestimates, since they do not take into account associated microorganisms which likely become extinct with the host organism, plant or animal. As multicellular species can have specific viral, prokaryotic, protistan and fungal species associated with them, extinction rates could be several times higher than assumed previously.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",6,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Weinbauer","given":"Markus G."},{"family":"Rassoulzadegan","given":"Fereidoun"}],"citation-key":"Weinbauer2007_ExtinctionMicrobes","container-title":"Endangered Species Research","container-title-short":"Endang.

Within that zone, geologically-rapid soil and saprolite displacement by biota, particularly invertebrate meso- and macrofauna, affects a large proportion of Earth's soils. This was first recognised by late-19th century observers, on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, who regarded bioturbation as fundamental to soil formation. Throughout much of the 20th century, however, the agronomical focus of soil scientists and the dominant paradigm of landscape evolution relegated bioturbation. As a result, many aspects of bioturbation are still not widely appreciated. Only in the last few decades has a re-evaluation commenced, in a range of disciplines. Primary effects of bioturbation, which we quantify herein, include soil production from saprolite, the formation of surface mounds, soil burial, and downslope transport. Rates of bioturbation can be as rapid as sustained maximum rates of tectonic uplift. In concert with surface geomorphic processes, bioturbation alters fundamental properties of soil, including particle-size distribution, porosity, the content of carbon and other nutrients, and creep flux rate. The precise influence of biotic mixing is regulated by its depth function. Earth's incredibly diverse soil biota also perform a number of functions, at a range of spatial and temporal scales, that extend beyond soil to landscape evolution, ecosystem engineering, niche construction, and carbon cycling. Understanding these linkages—which have operated since the evolution of trees in the Devonian Period—is of growing importance as we seek a fuller picture of Earth's history to predict and manage its future.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",3,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Wilkinson","given":"Marshall T."},{"family":"Richards","given":"Paul J."},{"family":"Humphreys","given":"Geoff S."}],"citation-key":"Wilkinson2009_Breakingground","container-title":"Earth-Science Reviews","container-title-short":"Earth-Science Reviews","DOI":"10.1016/j.earscirev.2009.09.005","ISSN":"0012-8252","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",12,1]]},"number":"1","page":"257-272","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Breaking ground: Pedological, geological, and ecological implications of soil bioturbation","title-short":"Breaking ground","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012825209001470","volume":"97"},{"id":"Willi2022_Conservationgenetics","abstract":"About 50 y ago, Crow and Kimura [An Introduction to Population Genetics Theory (1970)] and Ohta and Kimura [Genet.

This paper reports a synthesis of naturalness definitions, distinctions between the concepts of naturalness and of hemeroby and an analysis of different naturalness assessment approaches. Naturalness may be commonly defined as ‘the similarity of a current ecosystem state to its natural state’. Hemeroby, a concept related to human impacts, is often associated with naturalness but, in principle, the two concepts are not inversely related. The hemeroby concept defines narrow assessment classes for greater hemeroby, whereas the naturalness concept defines narrow assessment classes for great naturalness. The rapidly increasing number of forest naturalness papers relies on the following main indicators in decreasing order of use: tree species, forest structure, fauna, ground vegetation and deadwood. A review of the literature on forest naturalness suggests four main reasons for the lack of a widely accepted approach for assessing naturalness: (1) the lack of a commonly accepted reference concept, (2) an incomplete list of essential naturalness traits, (3) unknown linkages between some naturalness traits and biodiversity and (4) the lack of an assessment approach that can be adapted for use at both regional and large scales.

However, a comprehensive biodiversity impact assessment has so far not been performed. The aim of this study is to analyse how biodiversity is currently viewed in LCA, to highlight limitations and gaps and to provide recommendations for further research.\nMethod\nFirstly, biodiversity indicators are examined according to the level of biodiversity they assess (genetic, species, ecosystem) and to their usefulness for LCA. Secondly, relevant pressures on biodiversity that should be included in LCA are identified and available models (in and outside of an LCA context) for their assessment are discussed. Thirdly, existing impact assessment models are analysed in order to determine whether and how well pressures are already integrated into LCA. Finally, suggestions on how to include relevant pressures and impacts on biodiversity in LCA are provided and the necessary changes in each LCA phase that must follow are discussed.\nResults\nThe analysis of 119 indicators shows that 4% of indicators represent genetic diversity, 40% species diversity and 35% ecosystem diversity. 21% of the indicators consider further biodiversity-related topics. Out of the indicator sample, 42 indicators are deemed useful as impact indicators in LCA. Even though some identified pressures are already included in LCA with regard to their impacts on biodiversity (e.g. land use, carbon dioxide emissions etc.), other proven pressures on biodiversity have not yet been considered (e.g. noise, artificial light).\nConclusion\nFurther research is required to devise new options (e.g. impact assessment models) for integrating biodiversity into LCA.

Examination of data on species number of angiosperms and of land and freshwater birds on islands worldwide, ranging from Greenland and Spitsbergen to New Guinea and Jamaica, demonstrates that species-energy theory can explain 70 to 80% of the variation in species number on such widely varying islands, and further suggests the existence of regular geographic trends in resource utilization or species-abundance patterns. The concepts embodied in species-energy theory can in principle be used to develop predictions of species' abundances and probabilities of occurrence on an island.

New rapid survey approaches for monitoring biodiversity would greatly advance assessment and understanding of these threats. Taking advantage of next-generation DNA sequencing, we tested an approach we call metabarcoding: high-throughput and simultaneous taxa identification based on a very short (usually <100 base pairs) but informative DNA fragment. Short DNA fragments allow the use of degraded DNA from environmental samples. All analyses included amplification using plant-specific versatile primers, sequencing and estimation of taxonomic diversity. We tested in three steps whether degraded DNA from dead material in soil has the potential of efficiently assessing biodiversity in different biomes. First, soil DNA from eight boreal plant communities located in two different vegetation types (meadow and heath) was amplified. Plant diversity detected from boreal soil was highly consistent with plant taxonomic and growth form diversity estimated from conventional above-ground surveys. Second, we assessed DNA persistence using samples from formerly cultivated soils in temperate environments. We found that the number of crop DNA sequences retrieved strongly varied with years since last cultivation, and crop sequences were absent from nearby, uncultivated plots. Third, we assessed the universal applicability of DNA metabarcoding using soil samples from tropical environments: a large proportion of species and families from the study site were efficiently recovered. The results open unprecedented opportunities for large-scale DNA-based biodiversity studies across a range of taxonomic groups using standardized metabarcoding approaches.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",4,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Yoccoz","given":"N.

It builds on existing approaches and international standards. The overarching purpose of PEF information is to enable to reduce the environmental impacts of goods and services taking into account supply chain activities (from extraction of raw materials, through production and use and to final waste management). This purpose is achieved through the provision of detailed requirements for modelling the environmental impacts of the flows of material/energy and the emissions and waste streams associated with a product throughout its life cycle. The rules provided in the PEF method enable to conduct PEF studies that are more reproducible, comparable and verifiable, compared to existing alternative approaches. However, comparability is only possible if the results are based on the same product environmental footprint category rules (PEFCR).

However, there has been little quantitative analysis of the effects of this technique on yield variables. In this context, the present study aiming to provide a quantification of the effects of the co-inoculation of Bradyrhizobium and PGPR on the soybean crop using a meta-analysis approach. Methods A total of 42 published articles were examined, all of which considered the effects of co-inoculation of PGPR and Bradyrhizobium on the number of nodules, nodule biomass, root biomass, shoot biomass, shoot nitrogen content, and grain yield of soybean. We also determined whether the genus of the PGPR used as co-inoculant, as well as the experimental conditions, altered the effect size of the PGPR. Results The co-inoculation technology resulted in a significant increase in nodule number (11.40%), nodule biomass (6.47%), root biomass (12.84%), and shoot biomass (6.53%). Despite these positive results, no significant increase was observed in shoot nitrogen content and grain yield. The response of the co-inoculation varied according to the PGPR genus used as co-inoculant, as well as with the experimental conditions. In general, the genera Azospirillum, Bacillus, and Pseudomonas were more effective than Serratia. Overall, the observed increments were more pronounced under pot than that of field conditions. Collectively, this study summarize that co-inoculation improves plant development and increases nodulation, which may be important in overcoming nutritional limitations and potential stresses during the plant growth cycle, even though significant increases in grain yield have not been evidenced by this data meta-analysis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",6,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Zeffa","given":"Douglas M."},{"family":"Fantin","given":"Lucas H."},{"family":"Koltun","given":"Alessandra"},{"family":"Oliveira","given":"André L.

However, the effects of GCFs on microbial diversity is unclear despite that soil microorganisms play a critical role in biogeochemical cycling. Here, we synthesize 1235 GCF observations worldwide and show that microbial rare species are more sensitive to GCFs than common species, while GCFs do not always lead to a reduction in microbial diversity. GCFs-induced shifts in microbial alpha diversity can be predominately explained by the changed soil pH. In addition, GCF impacts on soil functionality are explained by microbial community structure and biomass rather than the alpha diversity. Altogether, our findings of GCF impacts on microbial diversity are fundamentally different from previous knowledge for well-studied plant and animal communities, and are crucial to policy-making for the conservation of microbial diversity hotspots under global changes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhou","given":"Zhenghu"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Chuankuan"},{"family":"Luo","given":"Yiqi"}],"citation-key":"Zhou2020_Metaanalysisimpacts","container-title":"Nature Communications","container-title-short":"Nat Commun","DOI":"10.1038/s41467-020-16881-7","ISSN":"2041-1723","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",6,17]]},"language":"en","number":"1","page":"3072","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Meta-analysis of the impacts of global change factors on soil microbial diversity and functionality","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-16881-7","volume":"11"},{"id":"Zurell2025_FoundationsSpecies","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",6,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Zurell","given":"Damaris"}],"citation-key":"Zurell2025_FoundationsSpecies","event-place":"Montpellier","event-title":"DeepSDM 2025","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",5]]},"publisher-place":"Montpellier","title":"Foundations of species distribution modelling: standards, challenges, and potential future directions","type":"speech","URL":"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qHYtIl6LYJTYVamY4WnCsnC4N4XPWRif"},{"id":"Faith1992_ConservationEvaluation","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Protecting biological diversity with limited resources may require placing conservation priorities on different taxa. A system of priorities that reflects the value of taxonomic diversity can be achieved by setting priorities such that the subset of taxa that is protected has maximum underlying feature diversity. Such feature diversity of taxon subsets is difficult to estimate directly, but can be predicted by the cladistic/phylogenetic relationships among the taxa. In this study, a simple measure of phylogenetic diversity is defined based on cladistic information. The measure of phylogenetic diversity, PD, is contrasted with a measure of taxic diversity recently developed by Vane-Wright et al. (Biol. Conserv., 55, 1991). In re-examining reserve-selection scenarios based on a phylogeny of bumble bees (Apidae), PD produces quite different priorities for species conservation, relative to taxic diversity. The potential application of PD at levels below that of the species is then illustrated using a mtDNA phylogeny for populations of crested newts Triturus cristatus. Calculation of PD for different population subsets shows that protection of populations at either of two extremes of the geographic range of the group can significantly increase the phylogenetic diversity that is protected.","container-title":"Biological Conservation","DOI":"10.1016/0006-3207(92)91201-3","ISSN":"0006-3207","issue":"1","journalAbbreviation":"Biological Conservation","page":"1-10","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Conservation evaluation and phylogenetic diversity","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0006320792912013","volume":"61","author":[{"family":"Faith","given":"Daniel P."}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",7,7]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["1992",1,1]]},"citation-key":"Faith1992_ConservationEvaluation","library":"My Library","citekey":"Faith1992_ConservationEvaluation"},{"id":"1990_ConservingWorlds","type":"report","language":"en","note":"ISBN: 0-915825-42-2\nIUCN, WRI, CI (Conservation Initiative), WWF, WorldBank","source":"Zotero","title":"Conserving the World's Biological Diversity","URL":"https://portals.iucn.org/library/sites/library/files/documents/1990-017.pdf","author":[{"family":"McNeely","given":"Jeffrey A"},{"family":"Miller","given":"Kenton R"},{"family":"Reid","given":"Walter V"},{"family":"Mittermeier","given":"Russell A"},{"family":"Werner","given":"Timothy B"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1990"]]},"citation-key":"1990_ConservingWorlds","library":"My Library","citekey":"1990_ConservingWorlds"}]
