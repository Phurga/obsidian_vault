## Article 1: assessment of land use impacts on soil biodiversity using environmental DNA and deep learning
Questions to answer
### what indicator to use to quantify soil biodiversity loss
[[indicator for ecosystem quality applicable to soil biodiversity]]
1. rationale on why the current indicator (PDF) cannot be used for soil biodiversity loss
	- species based concept application to soil
		- horizontal gene transfer, genetic pool
		- orders of magnitude of species count
		- identification of species
	- speciation and population dynamics in microbial communities
		- fast population dynamics for microbial communities
		- reference situtation temporal dynamics
		- reference situation climax vs land use
	- everything is everywhere : 
		- endemism, reference situation list of species
		- the species area relationship, alpha diversity or gamma diversity
		- extinction, dormancy
2. proposal of an alternative indicator
	- reduction in soil function (ecosytem quality as ecosytem functioning,use of soil quality framework)
	- reduction in mean multi-trophic group abundance (MGA)
	- reduction in unique habitat area (ecosystem diversity, [[red list of ecosystems]], [[EUNIS]] classification, ecoregion loss)
	- stress on evolutionary potential (genetic diversity)
### main trends in soil biodiversity to account for
- patterns of land use and land use intensity [[Labouyrie2023_Patternssoil]]
- geographical patterns [[Cameron2019_Globalmismatches]]
- adjusted to conservation policies
### calculation of the indicator
1. 
2. estimate average MGA for a given ecoregion under a given land use
3. 
- selection of an indicator for ecosystem quality that can be applied to soils, especially soil biodiversity
	- indicator is accepted by soil ecology community
	- indicator can be accepted by LCA community
	- indicator can be useful for decision making (environmental policy)
- selection of a model to derive the indicator
	- accounting for differences in land use and geographical location
- identify data sources allowing the operationalisation of the model
	- at regional scale (pilot, proof of concept), then at global scale
	- data needs for model inference but also for model validation/calibration
