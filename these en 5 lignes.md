Quantifying biodiversity impacts in Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is challenging due to biodiversityâ€™s complexity, especially the underrepresentation of soil organisms. Land use is a key driver of biodiversity loss, yet current indicators focus mainly on plants and vertebrates, overlooking soil taxa. This work aims to review indicators from the litterature in biodiversity LCIA, soil quality LCIA and soil ecology to propose consensus indicators and associated characterization factors. This approach will ackownledge for current limitations regarding data sources and scientific progress for soil ecology, and seeks to enhance future environmental assessments, informing policy and sustainability efforts.
