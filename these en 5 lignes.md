Quantifying biodiversity impacts in life cycle assessment is challenging due to the multifaceted nature of biodiversity. Land use is a key driver of biodiversity loss, yet the quantification of this effect is currently based on changes in plants and vertebrates richness due to data limitation, ignoring soil biodiversity although soil is estimated to host most of terrestrial species. This work aims to explore the use of environmental DNA to derive characterization factors for land use impacts on soil biodiversity. The nature of soil organisms also requires discussing the choice of the metric representing damages to ecosystem quality and its associated biodiversity.
