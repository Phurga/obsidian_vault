>[!abstract]-
>Product impacts on ecosystem quality have long been addressed by the topdown approach known as Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). Impacts are most of the time assessed within the “biodiversity loss” damage category indicator. However, LCA methods do not cover the 5 drivers of biodiversity loss as identiﬁed by (Millenium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005) (MEA): only land occupation and transformation, pollution, and climate change are covered, while species overexploitation and invasive species are not. Besides, ecologists work on the ground to measure concrete impacts from given practices on biodiversity in speciﬁc areas for some parts of the value chain of the product (e.g. production of agricultural biomaterial).
