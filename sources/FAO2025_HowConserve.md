### conservation focus shift from species to habitats
>Protection of individual species has historically been the goal of conservation bodies and it has  been relatively easy to define which species are under threat. For example the CITES Convention (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species Flora) clearly defines which species should be protected. Recently, the focus has shifted away from individual species to conservation of habitats through the use of “keystone” species which act as indicator organisms within a particular environment or ecosystem.
### soil specific conservation strategies
>In soil systems it is unlikely that we may ever know the true number and identify of all the species and it is virtually impossible to concentrate on a particular species because the same species may be found elsewhere (in an area not under threat) and they may interact more closely than in above ground habitats. In these cases, the strategy has been to focus on protecting the function of the ecosystem  - so called “ecosystem services”.
### link with conservation policies
> In 2006 the European Commission adopted the Thematic Strategy for Soil Protection of European soils. The proposed Directive “lays down a framework for the protection and sustainable use of soil based on the principles of integration of soil issues into other policies, preservation of soil functions within the context of sustainable use, prevention of threats to soil and mitigation of their effects, as well as restoration of degraded soils to a level of functionality consistent at least with the current and approved future use of the land.”
