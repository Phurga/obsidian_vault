### marginal or average characterization factor
>Marginal versus average modelling: These terms are used in different ways and meanings in the LCA context; here they describe two different impact modelling principles or choices: a marginal impact modelling approach represents the additional impact per additional unit emission/resource extraction caused by the product system on top of the existing background impact (which is not caused by the modelled product system). This allows, e.g. considering nonlinearity of impacts depending on local conditions like high or low background concen- trations to which the product systems adds an additional emission). An average impact modelling approach is strictly linear and represents an average impact independent from existing background impacts, which is similar to dividing the overall impact by the overall emissions. This is further discussed by Huijbregts et al. (2011). Note that marginal and average modelling are both suitable for small-scale interventions such as those related to a product or service. However, when medium-scale or large-scale interventions (or consequences) are to be assessed, the characterisation factors should represent non-marginal potential impacts and may also have to consider nonlinearity.
