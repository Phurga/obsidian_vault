>[!abstract]-
>Soil organisms represent the most biologically diverse community on land and govern the turnover of the largest organic matter pool in the terrestrial biosphere. The highly complex nature of these communities at local scales has traditionally obscured efforts to identify unifying patterns in global soil biodiversity and biogeochemistry. As a result, environmental covariates have generally been used as a proxy to represent the variation in soil community activity in global biogeochemical models. Yet over the past decade, broad-scale studies have begun to see past this local heterogeneity to identify unifying patterns in the biomass, diversity, and composition of certain soil groups across the globe. These unifying patterns provide new insights into the fundamental distribution and dynamics of organic matter on land.

# Zotero notes
> Soil stores the majority of organic matter in the terrestrial biosphere, with more carbon than vegetation and the atmosphere combined (9).
	
> Different soil communities process organic matter at very different rates and can fundamentally change the relationship between extrinsic environmental drivers and soil community functioning (Fig. 3C) (11, 25, 26).
