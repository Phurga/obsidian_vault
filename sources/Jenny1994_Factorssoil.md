>The vast importance of the soil in the development of various
systems of agriculture and types of civilizations has long been
recognized; but it is only within the last few decades that soils as such
have been studied in a scientific manner. During thousands of years
mankind has looked upon soils mainly from the utilitarian point of
view. Today it is being realized more and more that the soil per se is
worthy of scientific study, just as animals, plants, rocks, stars, etc., are
subjects for theoretical research and thought. There is every reason to
believe that any advance in the fundamental knowledge of soils will
immediately fertilize and stimulate practical phases of soil
investigations.
Since the beginning of the present century a great amount of work
on soil identification and mapping has been carried out in all parts of
the world. The detailed descriptions of the soil types investigated
embrace hundreds of volumes, charts, and atlases. Attempts to
coordinate the great mass of data frequently have been made, but
almost exclusively along the lines of soil classification. The idea of
classification has stood foremost in the minds of many great soil
scientists of the past, and the present-day leaders in field soil studies
continue in this same direction.
It should be remembered, however, that classification is not the
only way to systematize facts. Data can also be organized by means of
laws and theories. This method is characteristic of physics, chemistry,
and certain branches of biology, the amazing achievements of which
can be directly attributed to a great store of well-established numerical
laws and quantitative theories. The present treatise on soils attempts
to assemble soil data into a comprehensive scheme based on
numerical relationships. Soil properties are correlated with
independent variables commonly called "soil-forming factors." It is
believed that such a mode of approach will assist in the understanding
of soil differentiations and will help to explain the geographical
distribution of soil types. The ultimate goal of functional analysis is
the formulation of quantitative laws that permit mathematical
treatment. As yet, no correlation between soil properties and
conditioning factors has been found under field conditions which
satisfies the requirements of generality and rigidity of natural laws.
For this reason the less presumptuous name, "functional relationship,"
is chosen.
