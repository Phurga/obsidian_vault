>[!abstract]-
>This study uses direct measurements of soil nematode abundance from 6,825 georeferenced locations around the world, covering all continents and all terrestrial biomes. We describe the data sources, methodology and data processing steps to transform the data into a version that can be used for, for example, geospatial modeling. To do so, the samples were aggregated to the 1-km2 pixel level, each pixel is linked to 73 global covariate layers. These include on soil physiochemical properties, and vegetation, climate, and topographic, anthropogenic, and spectral reflectance information.
