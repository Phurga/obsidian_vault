## notes %% begin notes %% 

- Details a substance emissions to biodiversity and its damage pathway down.
- Does not give CFs for LCA.

 takeaway
- MNP impacts on biodiversity could not be characterized for LCA.
- Li identifies the main sources of MNP. 
- Primary and secondary sources of MNP are identified.
- Defines pathways up to humans for HH and nature for bioD. For instance harm on earthworms (lower carbon processing, reduced populations).
- Mentions cascade effects (eg MNP harm worms which harms soil fertility with harms human health)
- Pathway from emission to soil ecosystem services is only suggested:
	- TITAN to link MNP sources and species loss. "The TITAN method is suitable for translating predicted effects, such as physical and ecotoxicological effects (of MNPs), into quantitative measures of damage to species diversity ([Oginah, S.A., Posthuma, L., Maltby, L., Hauschild, M., Fantke, P., 2023. Linking freshwater ecotoxicity to damage on ecosystem services in life cycle assessment. Environ. Int. 107705](http://refhub.elsevier.com/S0048-9697\(23\)05550-X/rf0460).)". Other techniques can be used (quantile regression, species sensitivity distribution, DNA metabarcoding, dynamic energy budget).
	- Trait based approach to link species loss with damage on soil functional diversity.
	- Many approaches to link soil functional diversity to soil ecosystem services.
