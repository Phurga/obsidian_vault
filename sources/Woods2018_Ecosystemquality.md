>[!abstract]-
>Life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) results are used to assess potential environmental impacts of different products and services. As part of the UNEP-SETAC life cycle initiative flagship project that aims to harmonize indicators of potential environmental impacts, we provide a consensus viewpoint and recommendations for future developments in LCIA related to the ecosystem quality area of protection (AoP). Through our recommendations, we aim to encourage LCIA developments that improve the usefulness and global acceptability of LCIA results.

[[ecosystem quality]] and [[intrinsic value of nature]]
>With respect to impacts related to ecosystems, the life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) framework distinguishes between impacts affecting intrinsic values and instrumental values for humans ([[Verones2017_LCIAframework]]). The former mostly relates to current concerns for biodiversity loss, which is covered under the area of protection (AoP) ecosystem quality. Ecosystem services, the instrumental benefits people obtain from ecosystems, are foreseen as a future, additional AoP ([[Verones2017_LCIAframework]]).

[[Global Guidance on Environmental Life Cycle Impact Assessment Indicators]] is a UNEP-SETAC project aiming to harmonize LCIA methods. This is a summary of these discussions.
Uses [[Curran2011_MeaningfulEnd]] a lot as basis for clarification of needs on biodiv.
[[Ecosystem quality]] measures the condition of an [[ecosystem]] compared to a [[reference situation|reference state]]
Based on [[Curran2011_MeaningfulEnd]]: current endpoint indicators focus on species but miss impacts on ecosystem functions or structure (ie physical characteristics).

Possible indicators for ecosystem quality:
- species richness
- loss of functional diversity
- reduced ecosystem biomass
- reduced phylogenetic diversity
