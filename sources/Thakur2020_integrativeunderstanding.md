>[!abstract]-
>Soil is one of the most biodiverse terrestrial habitats. Yet, we lack an integrative conceptual framework for understanding the patterns and mechanisms driving soil biodiversity. One of the underlying reasons for our poor understanding of soil biodiversity patterns relates to whether key biodiversity theories (historically developed for aboveground and aquatic organisms) are applicable to patterns of soil biodiversity. Here, we present a systematic literature review to investigate whether and how key biodiversity theories (species–energy relationship, theory of island biogeography, metacommunity theory, niche theory and neutral theory) can explain observed patterns of soil biodiversity. We then discuss two spatial compartments nested within soil at which biodiversity theories can be applied to acknowledge the scale-dependent nature of soil biodiversity.

[[mechanisms leading to high soil species richness]]
>Anderson ([1975](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/brv.12567#brv12567-bib-0004)) highlighted that greater diversity of soil organisms is due to their lack of trophic specialization combined with widespread micro-scale abiotic heterogeneity

[[community ecology]]
> Here, we consider five biodiversity theories: (i) species–energy relationships, (ii) theory of island biogeography, (iii) metacommunity theory, (iv) niche theory, and (v) neutral theory.
