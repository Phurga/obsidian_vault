>[!abstract]-
>The French programme Réseau de Mesures de la Qualité des Sols e Biodiversité was carried out at a regional scale (Brittany, west part of France) i) to produce a ﬁrst statement regarding soil biodiversity, ii) to identify bioindicators of anthropic constraints, and iii) to determine baseline values for several biological groups depending on land uses. In this study, 109 monitoring sites were investigated using a systematic framework (a 16 km 16 km regular grid). Six biological groups were studied within four major categories, i.e., macrofauna (all soil macro-invertebrate taxa and earthworms), mesofauna (Acari and Collembola), microfauna (nematodes), and micro-organisms (microbial biomass and functional genes). The abundances of earthworms, nematodes, Acari and the bacterial community (assessed by their encoded 16S rRNA) as well as microbial biomass and earthworm species richness discriminate land uses (crops from meadows from forests). Macro-invertebrate abundance, Collembola abundance and richness, and nematode richness are only relevant for the discrimination of agricultural practices (e.g., management system or fertilisation intensity). Most of the soil biological groups (except Collembola) exhibit lower values of abundance and community richness in croplands than in meadows. This programme allows us to set up a ﬁrst reference database for soil biological data for France covering microﬂora and fauna. This substantial reference database will be used to calibrate future research results and to develop management baseline values for stakeholders to assess the status of soil biodiversity under several policies, e.g., the Common Agricultural Policy, Soil Framework Directive, EU and national biodiversity strategies, and policies related to contaminated land management. Therefore it should assist stakeholders in the choice of good agricultural practices.
