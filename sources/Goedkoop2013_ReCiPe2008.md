>[!abstract]-
>Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a methodological tool used to quantitatively analyse the life cycle of products/activities within the context of environmental impact. The application of this tool underwent major changes during the 1990s. It was initially developed to compare clearly defined end product alternatives, such as various forms of milk packaging or baby diapers. However, it has been rapidly incorporated into higher strategic levels, including decision- and policy-making at the firm/corporate levels. Life cycle assessment is currently used for assessing a wide range of products and activities, from ecolabeling to product design as well as energy systems, food production and transportation alternatives; it now clearly extends beyond only an assessment of end products. The current debate to which LCA is being subjected is closely linked to the involvement of stakeholders and the systematic use of quality assurance aspects, including peer review and uncertainty analyses. At an international level, the process of standardisation has yielded an ISO-standard (the 14040-series) and the establishment of working groups within the scientific community (SETAC) and within UNEP. At the same time, developments at the national level and within individual universities research centres and consultancy firms have led to a further development of procedures and methods for carrying out an LCA.

# Notes %% begin notes %% 

First incorporation of a SAR model to model endpoint impacts of land use on biodiversity in LCIA.

Has a midpoint impact system, with 3 indicators:
	- agricultural land occupation 
	- urban land occupation
	- natural land transformation

The midpoint is then converted to endpoint through a SAR model ($S=cA^z$)
The choice of $c$ and $z$ coefficient is discussed.
There is mention of $z$ coefficient being variable depending on area size, which seems strange to my current understanding. This also raises an issue for future works with fragmentation (or does it solve it ?).
The choice of regeneration times (restoration times) is discussed for transformation impacts.
The issues with edge effect is discussed.
The choice of marginal CFs is discussed.
