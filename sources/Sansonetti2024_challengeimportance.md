>Microbes represent 95% of the biodiversity of the living world, but when the issue of biodiversity preservation is raised, these invisible organisms rarely get a mention. To mark the International Day for Biological Diversity, Philippe Sansonetti, Professor Emeritus at the Institut Pasteur and the Collège de France, spoke about the importance of protecting microbial biodiversity.

# Zotero notes
> Microbes represent 95% of the biodiversity of the living world
	
> The main reason is because we can't see them
	
> There is no place on the planet, even in volcanic fumaroles, in the ocean depths or in bubbling geysers – which are populated with "extremophile" microbes – that does not have its own adapted ecosystem.
	
> Microbes, in all their diversity, play a crucial role in the planet's main vital cycles (carbon, methane and nitrogen), produce a large part of our oxygen, clean up the land and the oceans, and are involved in vital symbioses for the animal and plant world
	
> the impact of microbial biodiversity loss needs to be measured in terms of the immense diversity of the affected ecosystems. The spatio-temporal dynamics need to be determined and the effects need to be demonstrated scientifically
	
> Diversity loss in the human microbiota is associated with the emergence of non-communicable "postmodern" diseases such as allergies, asthma, atopy , obesity and diabetes, certain autoimmune diseases, inflammatory bowel disease, colorectal cancer, etc.
