[[sentientism]]
>Within nonanthropocentrism, **sentientism** is the view that only psychologically complex entities (e.g., those that experience pleasure and pain) need to have their interests considered (Singer 1977), while **biocentrism** is the view that the good of all living things need to be taken into account (Taylor 1986).
