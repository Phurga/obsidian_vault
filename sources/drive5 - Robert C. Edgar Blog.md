> ZOTUs are valid OTUs for diversity analysis etc., though the interpretation of the results is a bit different from the usual 97% OTUs. For example, it is expected that one species may have more than one ZOTU, and with 97% OTUs it is expected than an OTU may have more than one species.

> Different strains of a given species, say _E. coli_, often have differences in their 16S sequences. This adds a level of variation within a species on top of the variation that may occur within a single strain due to paralogs. Clustering tends to merge both levels of variation to create a single OTU, or at least fewer OTUs, for the species. This is not such a good thing if the goal is to get one OTU per phenotype, because different strains can have important differences in phenotype (e.g., pathogenic or not). Also, while the concept of a strain is reasonably well-defined (minimal variation in the compete genome), the concept of a species is problematic for bacteria ([Gevers et al. 2005](https://doi.org/10.1038/nrmicro1236),Â  [Doolittle and Pakpke 2006](https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/gb-2006-7-9-116)), so the goal of having one OTU per species is not so well-defined or useful
