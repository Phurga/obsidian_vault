[[biodiversity conservation paradox]]

> The first objective of the CBD is simply “the conservation of biological diversity,” and individual countries have pursued this objective in various ways, perhaps most often by providing legal protection to species at risk of extinction.

> Since the term biodiversity became widespread only in the late 1980s, ecologists have also been busy with the more mundane task of developing and calculating old and new indices to quantify it. The most straightforward index is species richness: the number of species in a given place and time. Indices of evenness aim to reflect the idea that, for example, a community with two equally abundant species is more diverse than one in which one of the species is dominant and the other very rare. Still other indices aim to capture phylogenetic or functional trait diversity, whereby a forest with both pine trees and maple trees is considered more diverse than one with only two species of pine (or maple) trees (see the figure at left). **Species richness is the only metric that has been reported often enough, and in a sufficiently standardized way, to allow general comparisons across different regions, habitats, taxa, or scales of space and time.**

> Species are being transported and introduced to new places around the world, so that **regional diversity often increases, even as global diversity declines**.

> The net result of human activities in recent centuries thus appears on average to have been an increase, or at least no change, in species richness at the regional scale. If biodiversity is good, this news ought to be good, but one would be hard-pressed to find an ecologist who would say that. So, **at the local or regional scale, perhaps it is not really biodiversity per se that we value**.

> For decades, environmental historians and conservation biologists have been discussing the reasons people value nature—and biodiversity. Some values are profoundly personal, such as feelings of moral obligation to protect nonhuman life or a spiritual connection with wild nature.

> In the 1980s, Paul and Anne Ehrlich likened species extinctions to the loss of rivets from an airplane—a few popped rivets might have no effect, a few too many and the plane crashes. These studies effectively test this hypothesis.

> We have already learned that nonnative species introductions have caused regional-scale biodiversity to increase rather than decrease in recent centuries. And if more species means better-functioning ecosystems, then the net effect of many nonnative species introductions and few native extinctions should be enhanced ecosystem function. Here the “biodiversity is good” argument collides with the “nonnative species are bad” argument, revealing an inconsistency.

> Agriculture in particular is the primary culprit implicated in the worldwide loss of natural habitat. But the link between biodiversity decline and ecosystem services in this case is not so simple. People convert natural vegetation to crop fields deliberately to maximize one ecosystem service: food production. Land conversion to agriculture can come at a steep cost to other ecosystem services, such as soil stabilization and water quality, and the use of crop mixtures rather than monocultures (which translates to greater biodiversity) can potentially contribute to strategies aimed at offsetting such costs. But **how can we compare the relative value of a thousand bushels of corn versus less nitrogen in a stream? If you’ve got nothing to eat, the corn wins out**; if you’ve got plenty to eat, maybe forest protection is the better strategy.

> Returning to the biodiversity conservation paradox, I now think that perhaps its ultimate resolution lies in the fact that **scientific definitions of biodiversity fail to capture what people really value about nature**. If biodiversity is quantified in an objective way as some aspect of **variety in an ecological community**, then biodiversity can be high in a place that would be assigned low conservation value. (...) But if biodiversity is defined as whatever people value about nature, then science has nothing to contribute to the question of whether and how biodiversity has value.

> Saving the concept of biodiversity might require more clearly circumscribing the role of science in conservation. If, for example, an endangered species has no scientifically known or even plausibly hypothesized unique benefit to human well-being, we should be honest that **the motivation for protection is driven by ethical values**. It is important to note that such honesty requires acknowledging that the question of **what society should do about a given situation (for example, a species at risk of extinction) is outside the realm of science**, and so a scientist’s values carry no more weight than anyone else’s. In contrast, **scientists do have a special standing when it comes to giving advice on how to achieve conservation policy** or management goals and on predicting the possible consequences of action or inaction on a range of issues, including pollution, global warming, and land-use change.
