>[!abstract]-
>The UNEP-SETAC life cycle initiative recently recommended use of the countryside species-area relationship (SAR) model to calculate the characterization factors (CFs; potential species loss per m2) for projecting the biodiversity impact of land use associated with a products' life cycle. However, CFs based on this approach are to date available for only six broad land use types without differentiating between their management intensities and have large uncertainties that limit their practical applicability. Here we derive updated CFs for projecting potential species losses of five taxa resulting from five broad land use types (managed forests, plantations, pasture, cropland, urban) under three intensity levels (minimal, light, and intense use) in each of the 804 terrestrial ecoregions. We utilize recent global land use intensity maps and International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) habitat classification scheme to parametrize the SAR model. As a case study, we compare the biodiversity impacts of 1 m3 of wood produced under four different forest management regimes in India and demonstrate that the new land use intensity-specific CFs have smaller uncertainty intervals and are able to discern the impacts of intensively managed land uses from the low intensity regimes, which has not been possible through previous CFs.

### defining phylogenetic diversity
> More phylogenetic diversity offers the region both more functional diversity (and so, e.g., more resilience) and more options to respond to a changing world.
> 
> It has been argued that the biodiversity value of  a region is better estimated by the amount of phylogenetic diversity  hosted by it rather than just its species richness (see, e.g., Crozier,  1997; Faith, 1992; Jetz et al., 2014; Mace, Gittleman, & Purvis, 2003;  Safi, Armour-Marshall, Baillie, & Isaac, 2013). The main argument  here is that the PD in a region measures the evolutionary information within its flora/fauna, and more PD offers the region both more  functional diversity (and so, e.g., more resilience) and more options to  respond to a changing world (see, e.g., Collen et al., 2011; Mace et al.,  2003).
