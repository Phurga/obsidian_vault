>[!abstract]-
>Humans are transforming the biosphere in unprecedented ways, raising the important question of how these impacts are changing biodiversity. Here we argue that our understanding of biodiversity trends in the Anthropocene, and our ability to protect the natural world, is impeded by a failure to consider different types of biodiversity measured at different spatial scales. We propose that ecologists should recognize and assess 15 distinct categories of biodiversity trend. We summarize what is known about each of these 15 categories, identify major gaps in our current knowledge, and recommend the next steps required for better understanding of trends in biodiversity.

### land cover change is of the five main pressures on biodiversity
> Land-cover change – human-caused land-cover change typically decreases species richness in the changed area. However, by creating more heterogeneous habitat structure, meta-community to biogeographical-scale species richness can increase by, for example, bringing in edge or open habitat species (see [Figure 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169534714002456#fig0005) in main text) [[66]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169534714002456#bib0355). 
> Also, during restoration or recovery from disturbance, species richness often peaks at intermediate successional stages rather than either immediately after change or at the original ‘climax’ state [[67]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169534714002456#bib0360).
### alpha diversity, beta diversity, abundance
>Species richness is the most natural measure of alpha (α) diversity. However, there are other reasons why we rate the field or mudflat as low in biodiversity. Experience leads us to expect variation across space [18](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169534714002456#bib0115); without it, we consider a system low in biodiversity. This aspect of diversity is known as beta (β) diversity [19](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169534714002456#bib0120). Beta diversity is the change in species composition per unit space (or time; see [Glossary](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169534714002456#tb0005)); relatively homogeneous systems such as wheat fields and mudflats lack this spatial turnover and change in species composition. The final reason we say a mudflat (although perhaps not a fertilized wheat field) is low in biodiversity is simply the paucity of biomass (or numerical abundance of organisms). This example suggests that measures of abundance and biomass should also be considered when assessing [human impacts](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/anthropogenic-effect "Learn more about human impacts from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") on biodiversity. Biomass is often strongly correlated with various ecosystem functions [20](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169534714002456#bib0125) and abundance and species richness are correlated [21](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169534714002456#bib0130), [22](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169534714002456#bib0135) suggesting value in disentangling the two effects.
### spatial scale of biodiversity assessment
>Although spatial scale is a continuous variable, here we recognize four distinct scales of organization for biodiversity studies: local, meta-community, biogeographical, and global.
