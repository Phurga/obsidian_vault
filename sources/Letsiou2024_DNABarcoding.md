>In the last two decades, plant taxonomy has bloomed, following the development of a novel technique, namely, DNA barcoding. DNA barcodes are standardized sequences, ideally unique, coding or non-coding, either from the genome of the organism or from its organelles, that are used to identify/classify an organismal group; in short, the method includes amplification of the DNA barcode, sequencing and comparison with a reference database containing the relevant sequences from different species. In plants, the use a universal DNA barcode, such as COI, which is used in animals, has not been achieved so far. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the progress made in DNA barcoding within the field of plant taxonomy. It highlights the success of various barcode loci, the emergence of super barcodes from the chloroplast genome, and the overall impact of next-generation sequencing technologies on the field. The discussion of different approaches reflects the ongoing efforts to refine and optimize DNA barcoding techniques for plants, contributing to the advancement in our understanding of plant biodiversity.
