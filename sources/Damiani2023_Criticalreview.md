>[!abstract]-
>Global biodiversity is in rapid decline and halting biodiversity loss is one of the most important challenges humanity must tackle now and in the immediate future. The five main direct drivers of biodiversity loss are climate change, pollution, land use, overexploitation of resources and the spread of invasive species, which result from indirect drivers such as unsustainable production and consumption. It is therefore of paramount importance that scientifically robust methods are developed to capture impacts on biodiversity from a value-chain perspective. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology allows to quantify the impact of products and organisations throughout their whole life cycle. In the LCA framework, several methods for biodiversity impact assessment have been developed. Building on previous reviews, this article aims to critically analyse methods and models for biodiversity impact assessment in LCA and beyond as comprehensively as possible, and to select those that may be most suitable for application in an LCA context. 64 methods were reviewed and 23 were selected for a detailed analysis based on availability of documentation, domain of application, geographical scope, potential to be used in LCA, and added value. The analysis addressed their goal and scope, data use and needs, and impact assessment characteristics, revealing strengths and weaknesses of the methods. There is currently no method that takes well into account at the same time the variety of pressures on biodiversity, ecosystems, taxonomic groups, essential biodiversity variables classes, and the fundamental aspects to consider in biodiversity impact assessments â€“ but for each of these five criteria, we show which methods perform best. For the future development of biodiversity impact assessment, it is required to improve the coverage of drivers of biodiversity loss, increase ecosystem and taxonomic coverage, include the assessment of ecosystem services, and develop robust indicators that allow for complementary analysis of more essential biodiversity aspects.

details state of the art for biodiv assessment in LCA (not specific to soils)
provides a framework to assess the comprehensiveness of a method
 takeaways :
- Comprehensive biodiv assessment must cover all pressures, ecosystems, taxons, species extinction, degradation of ecosystem services ([https://doi.org/10.1007/s11367-020-018461](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11367-020-01846-1)). 
- In 2023, no methods cover everything. But several methods have high coverages. Coverages are complimentary.
- Study focuses on coverage but does not concludes on the scientific robustness of methods. 
- note on taxonomic groups: for soil biodiv, most of the biodiv is bacteria (in others below), arthropods, earthworms (in annelids), fungi,algae (chlorophyta, cyanophyta (latter not below)), and few mammals such as amphibians.

Note:
- Habitat Change Potential (HCP) method ([[Damiani2021_highresolutionlife]]) is only on freshwater habitats.

Side notes
- Methods are either MSA or PDF based.
- Lacking data on some species groups
- High coverage ones are Recipe, LC impact, IW+, GEP, PBF.
- There are debates on how to consider the reference state, which is important (renaturalised or pre study) [https://doi.org/10.1007/s11367-01901594-x](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11367-019-01594-x)
- Builds on Crenna et al 2020, Lammerant et al 2018.

#todo/question Why not link species traits with ecosystem function ? not sure what is meant by ecosystem function. It is said that high trait diversity is linked with healthy ecosystem.
