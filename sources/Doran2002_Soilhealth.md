>[!abstract]-
>Interest in the quality and health of soil has been stimulated by recent awareness that soil is vital to both production of food and ﬁber and global ecosystems function. Soil health, or quality, can be broadly deﬁned as the capacity of a living soil to function, within natural or managed ecosystem boundaries, to sustain plant and animal productivity, maintain or enhance water and air quality, and promote plant and animal health. Soil quality and health change over time due to natural events or human impacts. They are enhanced by management and land-use decisions that weigh the multiple functions of soil and are impaired by decisions which focus only on single functions, such as crop productivity. Criteria for indicators of soil quality and health relate mainly to their utility in deﬁning ecosystem processes and in integrating physical, chemical, and biological properties; their sensitivity to management and climatic variations; and their accessibility and utility to agricultural specialists, producers, conservationists, and policy makers. Although soils have an inherent quality as related to their physical, chemical, and biological properties within the constraints set by climate and ecosystems, the ultimate determinant of soil quality and health is the land manager. As such, the assessment of soil quality or health, and direction of change with time, is the primary indicator of sustainable management. Scientists can make a signiﬁcant contribution to sustainable land management by translating scientiﬁc knowledge and information on soil function into practical tools and approaches by which land managers can assess the sustainability of their management practices. The ﬁrst steps, however, in our communal journey towards sustainable land management must be the identiﬁcation of our ﬁnal destination (sustainability goals), the strategies or course by which we will get there, and the indicators (benchmarks) that we are proceeding in the right direction. We too often rush to raise the sails of our ‘technological’ ship to catch the wind, before knowing from where it comes or in properly deﬁning our destination, charting our course, and setting the rudder of our ship. Examples are given of approaches for assessing soil quality and health to deﬁne the sustainability of land management practices and to ‘translate our science into practice’. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Foundational paper for [[soil quality]] refered to in [[Vidal-Legaz2017_Soilquality]].
Definition inhere links back to previous work done by [[Doran, John W.]] in 1996 and 1998. It seems ok to link to this paper rather than prior ones (1996 is not very accurate https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0065211308601789 and 1998 is hard to find as it is a proceedings)
