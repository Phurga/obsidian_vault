>[!abstract]-
>The nations of the world have set themselves a target of reducing the rate of biodiversity loss by 2010. Here, we propose a biodiversity intactness index (BII) for assessing progress towards this target that is simple and practical—but sensitive to important factors that influence biodiversity status—and which satisfies the criteria for policy relevance set by the Convention on Biological Diversity. Application of the BII is demonstrated on a large region (4 × 106 km2) of southern Africa. The BII score in the year 2000 is about 84%: in other words, averaged across all plant and vertebrate species in the region, populations have declined to 84% of their presumed pre-modern levels. The taxonomic group with the greatest loss is mammals, at 71% of pre-modern levels, and the ecosystem type with the greatest loss is grassland, with 74% of its former populations remaining. During the 1990s, a population decline of 0.8% is estimated to have occurred.

definition of [[biodiversity intactness index]]

> The BII is an indicator of the average abundance of a large and diverse set of organisms in a given geographical area, relative to their reference populations. ^b08fcb

> We recommend calculating the BII across all species within the broad taxonomic groups that are reasonably well described. For most parts of the world this **includes plants and vertebrates, and excludes invertebrates and microbes**, which are diverse but poorly documented. We exclude alien species in the calculation of the index. ^b3f06c

> In the case of biodiversity, we estimate the impacts of a set of land use activities on the population sizes of groups of ecologically similar species (‘functional types’).

> A total of 4,650 estimates of _I__ijk_ were made, comprising five broad taxonomic groups, each with at least three experts, six ecosystem types, an average of six land use activities and eight functional types.
