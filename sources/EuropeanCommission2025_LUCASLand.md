>[!abstract]-
>The European Union (EU) is composed of a diverse range of landscapes: it is home to a wide variety of flora and fauna and includes some of the most and least densely populated areas of the world. This background article provides information on the Land Use/Cover Area frame Survey (LUCAS), a survey that provides harmonised and comparable statistics on land use and land cover across the whole of the EUâ€™s territory. The data collected by LUCAS provides harmonised information for studying a range of socioenvironmental challenges, such as land take, soil degradation or biodiversity.
