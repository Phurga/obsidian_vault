# Notes %% begin notes %%
In this method De Baan uses a [[species-area-relationship|SAR]] to model predicted species loss with increased land use. They use a [[matrix SAR]] to integrate species affinity with given land uses.
I think this is the first version for [[species extinction risk|species extinction]], but not yet [[global extinction probability|GEP]].

Data
> Data on original species richness and endemism of mammals, birds, amphibians, and reptiles were derived from the WWF WildFinder database. 32,45 Because no data on plant endemism are available per ecoregion (Holger Kreft, Pers. comm.), permanent impacts could not be calculated for plants. Total plant species richness (Kier et al. 46 ) was used to calculate occupation and transformation impacts.
