>[!abstract]-
>Land use and changes in land use have a significant impact on biodiversity. Still, there is no agreed upon methodology for how this impact should be assessed and included in LCA. This paper presents a methodology for including land use impact on biodiversity in Life Cycle Impact Assessment and provides a case example from forestry operations in Norway.

## notes %% begin notes %%
This method is quoted as resource in [[Lindner2018_consistentvariablescale]]. It mentions being one example of operational [[parameter based LCIA method]], opposite to [[class based LCIA methods]].
The method focuses on [[forest]] land use (the author is Norwegian).
The basis for the method is that the [[ecosystem quality]] is quantified as a product of three parameters:
- ecosystem scarcity (ES), based on the potential ecosystem area (can be several scale),
- ecosystem vulnerability (EV), based on the current loss of the ecosystem, using the [[species-area relationship|SAR]] as basis for calculation, normalized to the most vulnerable ecosystem,
- conditions for maintained biodiversity (CMB), based on 17 parameters based on [[Larsson2001_BiodiversityEvaluation]]. The value of the parameters is based on a rough scale (0 to 9 based on parameter impact on biodiversity), normalized to the max values of each parameters.
[[reference situation]]: situation before the conversion
