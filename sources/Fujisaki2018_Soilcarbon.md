>[!abstract]-
>Soil organic carbon (SOC) balance is an important component of the terrestrial carbon (C) budget. However, eﬀect of cropland management changes on SOC dynamics has not been recently assessed in the tropics. Studies were compiled in the tropics where SOC stocks were measured in the topsoil (0–20 or 0–30 cm depth) after the adoption of management practices that are expected to enhance SOC stocks, including tillage reduction, crop rotation, exogenous organic amendments, restitution of crop residues, mineral amendments, and combinations of these practices. Random forest regression was used to identify the determinants of SOC accumulation rates (ΔSOC) depending on the climate, soil characteristics and changes in management practices.
