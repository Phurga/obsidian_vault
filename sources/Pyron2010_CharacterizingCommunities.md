### [[measures of biodiversity]]
> Three levels of diversity have been studied by community ecologists. Alpha diversity is within-habitat diversity. Beta diversity is between-habitat diversity. This refers to changes in diversity along an environmental gradient. Gamma diversity or large-scale landscape diversity combines alpha diversity and beta diversity.

### criticism of diversity indices
> All diversity indices are criticized because they combine the number of species and the relative species abundances for one area into a single index, confounding these variables (Ludwig & Reynolds 1988).
### defining species diversity indices
> Species richness is simply the number of species in a community. Species diversity is more complex, and includes a measure of the number of species in a community, and a measure of the abundance of each species. Species diversity is usually described by an index, such as Shannonâ€™s Index H'.
### abundance measures
> Abundance patterns in communities can be examined by numbers of individuals per species, biomass per species, or percent cover per species.
### habitat heterogeneity drives species diversity
> Species diversity tends to increase with habitat heterogeneity. Communities that have increased habitat variation have an increased number of ways to divide up the available niches. The number or variation of available niches varies by organism-type. Plant niches tend to be defined by different variables than animal niches. Plant species richness may vary with variation in local soil properties. Animal species richness may vary with the complexity of the habitat form, for example vegetation structure. Thus habitat heterogeneity is both context and species dependent.
