>Biodiversity- crucial for ecosystem health and its products and services â€“ is being lost at an alarming rate. While it is clear that human consumption is the main driving force of the considerable losses, conversion of natural habitats for production is continuing and the subsequent intensification of those systems is likely to cause even further biodiversity decay. Insights in consumption-based biodiversity loss, or biodiversity footprints, offer starting points for policy to reduce global biodiversity loss. To assess environmental performances of production systems, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) can be applied. This is an internationally recognised methodology to map the environmental impact of a product, chain or activity from the beginning to the end of the life cycle. While certain impacts, such as those of climate change, are readily incorporated into standardised LCAs, methodologies for impacts on biodiversity are still being developed.
