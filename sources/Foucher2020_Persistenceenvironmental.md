>[!abstract]-
>eDNA refers to DNA extracted from an environmental sample with the goal of identifying the occurrence of past or current biological communities in aquatic and terrestrial environments. However, there is currently a lack of knowledge regarding the soil memory effect and its potential impact on lake sediment eDNA records. To investigate this issue, two contrasted sites located in cultivated environments in France were studied. In the first site, soil samples were collected (n = 30) in plots for which the crop rotation history was documented since 1975. In the second site, samples were collected (n = 40) to compare the abundance of currently observed taxa versus detected taxa in cropland and other land uses. The results showed that the last cultivated crop was detected in 100% of the samples as the most abundant. In addition, weeds were the most abundant taxa identified in both sites. Overall, these results illustrate the potential of eDNA analyses for identifying the recent (< 10 years) land cover history of soils and outline the detection of different taxa in cultivated plots. The capacity of detection of plant species grown on soils delivering sediments to lacustrine systems is promising to improve our understanding of sediment transfer processes over short timescales.
