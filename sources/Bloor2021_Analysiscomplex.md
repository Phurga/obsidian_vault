>Increasing evidence suggests that agricultural intensification is a threat to many groups of soil biota, but how the impacts of land-use intensity on soil organisms translate into changes in comprehensive soil interaction networks remains unclear. Here for the first time, we use environmental DNA to examine total soil multi-trophic diversity and food web structure for temperate agroecosystems along a gradient of land-use intensity. We tested for response patterns in key properties of the soil food webs in sixteen fields ranging from arable crops to grazed permanent grasslands as part of a long-term management experiment. We found that agricultural intensification drives reductions in trophic group diversity, although taxa richness remained unchanged. Intensification generally reduced the complexity and connectance of soil interaction networks and induced consistent changes in energy pathways, but the magnitude of management-induced changes depended on the variable considered. Average path length (an indicator of food web redundancy and resilience) did not respond to our management intensity gradient. Moreover, turnover of network structure showed little response to increasing management intensity. Our data demonstrates the importance of considering different facets of trophic networks for a clearer understanding of agriculture-biodiversity relationships, with implications for nature-based solutions and sustainable agriculture.

### impacts of intensification on trophic diversity
> We found that agricultural intensification drives reductions in trophic group diversity, although taxa richness remained unchanged. Intensification generally reduced the complexity and connectance of soil interaction networks and induced consistent changes in energy pathways, but the magnitude of management-induced changes depended on the variable considered. Average path length (an indicator of food web redundancy and resilience) did not respond to our management intensity gradient. Moreover, turnover of network structure showed little response to increasing management intensity.
### intensification does not always lead to negative soil biodiversity response
> Indeed, recent evidence suggests that intensive land-use management decreases the complexity of soil bacterial networks[17](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-97300-9#ref-CR17 "Karimi, B. et al. Biogeography of soil bacterial networks along a gradient of cropping intensity. Sci. Rep. 9, 3812 (2019)."), as well as that of soil networks based on a relatively-limited number of micro-/mesofaunal groups[8](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-97300-9#ref-CR8 "Creamer, R. E. et al. Ecological network analysis reveals the inter-connection between soil biodiversity and ecosystem function as affected by land use across Europe. Appl. Soil. Ecol. 97, 112–124 (2016)."),[9](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-97300-9#ref-CR9 "Tsiafouli, M. A. et al. Intensive agriculture reduces soil biodiversity across Europe. Glob. Change Biol. 21, 973–985 (2015)."). However, agricultural intensification is not consistently harmful to soil fauna diversity[16](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-97300-9#ref-CR16 "de Graaff, M. A., Hornslein, N., Throop, H., Kardol, P. & van Diepen, L. T. A. Effects of agricultural intensification on soil biodiversity and implications for ecosystem functioning: A meta-analysis. Adv. Agron. 155, 1–44 (2019)."),[18](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-97300-9#ref-CR18 "Wardle, D. A., Nicholson, K. S., Bonner, K. I. & Yeates, G. W. Effects of agricultural intensification on soil-associated arthropod population dynamics, community structure, diversity and temporal variability over a seven-year period. Soil Biol. Biochem. 31, 1691–1706 (1999)."),[19](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-97300-9#ref-CR19 "Gossner, M. M. et al. Land-use intensification causes multitrophic homogenization of grassland communities. Nature 540, 266–269 (2016)."), and variation or non-linearity in species responses may therefore lead to idiosyncratic effects on complete food web structure.
### studying interaction is more effective than species loss 
> Given that loss of interactions among species may also supersede the effects of species loss within trophic groups on ecosystem function[20](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-97300-9#ref-CR20 "Valiente-Banuet, A. et al. Beyond species loss: The extinction of ecological interactions in a changing world. Funct. Ecol. 29, 299–307 (2015)."), there is a pressing need for data on the responses of complex soil interaction networks to land-use intensification.
## methods
Use of [[GBIF]]
### OTU to taxonomy
>We first determined the complete taxonomic tree for the OTUs using DNA reference databases and the Name Parser API of the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF)[55](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-97300-9#ref-CR55 "G.B.I.F. GBIF backbone taxonomy. (2017).").
### quantification of land use intensity
> In the present study, we used an unweighted, multicriteria approach ([[Bluthgen2012_QuantitativeIndex]]) and calculated a continuous LUI index based on management practices over the preceding 6-year period. Our approach and choice of criteria allowed the positioning of very different agroecosystems (permanent grasslands, annual cropping systems) along a standardised gradient, and the site ranking obtained was subsequently validated by expert opinion (ANAEE-F ACBB site managers). Our calculation of the intensification gradient also provided an objective method to quantify the differences in agricultural intensification between sites, which is not pos- sible to achieve based on expert knowledge alone.
### classification of taxon in multi-trophic groups
>We assigned taxa to trophic groups using an automatic inference technique and machine-learning approach to avoid limitations of subjective, user-defined groups[58](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-97300-9#ref-CR58 "Makiola, A. et al. Key questions for next-generation biomonitoring. Front. Environ. Sci. 7, 197 (2020)."); stochastic block models (SBM)[59](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-97300-9#ref-CR59 "Nowicki, K. & Snijders, T. A. B. Estimation and prediction for stochastic block structures. J. Am. Stat. Assoc. 96, 1077–1087 (2001).") were fitted to the heuristic metaweb using the “blockmodels” package in R (Supplementary Fig. [S3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-97300-9#MOESM2)).
