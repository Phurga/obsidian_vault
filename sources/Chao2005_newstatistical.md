>[!abstract]-
>The classic Jaccard and Sørensen indices of compositional similarity (and other indices that depend upon the same variables) are notoriously sensitive to sample size, especially for assemblages with numerous rare species. Further, because these indices are based solely on presence–absence data, accurate estimators for them are unattainable. We provide a probabilistic derivation for the classic, incidence-based forms of these indices and extend this approach to formulate new Jaccard-type or Sørensen-type indices based on species abundance data. We then propose estimators for these indices that include the effect of unseen shared species, based on either (replicated) incidence- or abundance-based sample data. In sampling simulations, these new estimators prove to be considerably less biased than classic indices when a substantial proportion of species are missing from samples. Based on species-rich empirical datasets, we show how incorporating the effect of unseen shared species not only increases accuracy but also can change the interpretation of results.

### history of abundance similarity metric
> A modified version of the Sørensen index was developed by Bray & Curtis (1957), based on abundance data (also known as the Sørensen abundance index; Magurran 2004), and a large number of other abundance-based indices have been developed (Legendre & Legendre 1998), including the widely applied Morisita–Horn index (Magurran 2004).
### proposed indicator
> We based a new similarity index on the *probability that two randomly chosen individuals, one from each of two samples, both belong to any of the species shared by the two samples* (not necessarily to the same shared species, the basis of F (Chave & Leigh 2002; Condit et al. 2002) and the Morisita–Horn index). This approach opened the way to the crucial step, adjusting this probability to account for the chance that larger samples would reveal a larger proportion of shared species.
