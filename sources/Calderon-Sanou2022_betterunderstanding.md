Introduction can be reused for context on soil biodiversity.

[[use of abundance and richness for microorganisms diversity]]
>For soil organisms, the traditional measures of abundance can vary across taxonomic subfields and can represent a real challenge for some organisms, e.g., delimiting fungal individuals. Biomass or relative abundances retrieved form DNA sequencing methods could be more adequate measures of abundance to be compare across soil organisms from different kingdoms (Fierer et al. 2009; Shade et al. 2018)

[[diversity within and among trophic groups]]
> In a multi-trophic approach, diversity can be addressed from two dimensions. A first dimension constitutes the diversity within trophic groups (e.g., species diversity). A second dimension constitutes the diversity across trophic groups (e.g., the number of trophic groups, the diversity of trophic interactions). (...) The second dimension is also referred to as food web diversity or food web structure throughout this manuscript.

[[soil food web#channels]]
> Traditionally, energy flowing through the soil food web has been categorized into energy ‘channels’ based on the basal resource at the origin of the channel, e.g., green channel (from plants) vs brown channel (from organic matter), or fast channel (bacteria-based) vs low channel (fungi-based) (Moore & de Ruiter 1991; de Vries et al. 2013). Despite the fact that the terminology of ‘channel’ is widely used in the literature to relate food webs to functions or processes, recent evidence points out the existence of reticulate channels because groups in low trophic levels can feed on multiple energy channels (e.g. omnivore protists that feed on both bacteria and fungi), complexifying the separation of the food web into the traditional binary categories (Geisen et al. 2016; Potapov et al. 2021).

[[disturbance gradients]]
>(...) disturbance gradients are widely used to understand the role of natural disturbances in maintaining biodiversity at local scales, because disturbances promote local heterogeneity, control spatio-temporal dynamics and drive successional trajectories (Fig.4B) (Thom & Seidl 2016)

[[the intermediate disturbance hypothesis]]
>the Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis postulates that biodiversity peaks at intermediate levels of disturbance, where both colonist and climax species are able to coexist and decline at low and high levels of disturbance where they are mutually excluded by exploitative competition (Grime 1973; Horn 1974; Connell 1978)

[[food web networks metrics]]
> For this, one approach consists of summarising the structure of the food web through network metrics (e.g. connectance, modularity, vulnerability, etc) and related them to ecological processes (Braga et al. 2019), but the real meaning of these metrics or the ecological information they provide still in debate (Thompson et al. 2012).

[[use of eDNA metabarcoding for soil biodiversity]]
> The detection of DNA in a soil sample may occur because the living organism is present in the sample in an active or dormant stage (e.g. bacteria), or because traces remain to attest to the presence of the organism in the sample or in its vicinity revealing its presence in the community (e.g. carcasses, skin, faeces, body fluid, etc) (Barnes & Turner 2016)

[[low correlation between OTU read abundance and species true abundance]]
>In the same way, the number of sequencing reads can’t be interpreted as a measure of species abundance. Some studies have found a positive correlation between the relative abundance of sequencing reads and the biomass across samples in experimental studies or through simulations (Deiner et al. 2017; Kelly et al. 2019). However, several factors related to the ‘nature’ of the eDNA (e.g., origin, stability) can affect this relationship (Barnes & Turner 2016).

[[ecological filtering]]
>From the global or regional pool of species, the local composition of a realized community is the consequence of both the dispersal ability of species and their biogeographic history, i.e., ‘dispersal filter’ (Sexton et al. 2009), and, the capacity of the species to establish and reproduce under the local environmental conditions, i.e., ‘niche filter’ (Cornwell et al. 2006).
