# Notes %% begin notes %% 
Part of the [[GLAM]]. This is a global guideline for [[LCA]] practicioners and method developers. The 2019 report focused on [[biodiversity]] and required developments.

Focusing here on two chapters: 
- chapter 6 focuses on land use impacts on soil quality
- chapter 2.4 focuses on cross cutting issues related to biodiversity impact assessment
## Chapter 6 : Land use impacts on soil quality
[[LCIA method on soil quality]]
## Chapter 2.4
[[LCIA method on ecosystem quality]]
[[species extinction risk|vulnerability]]
[[ecosystem quality]]
[[species richness]] (PDF)
[[taxonomy]] specific PDF measures


>[[Functional diversity]] (i.e., set of functions that organisms perform in a specific level of organisation, such as an ecosystem) is an important aspect to ensure the maintenance of ecosystem functioning, along with functional redundancy (i.e., capacity of organisms to function in a similar manner). Hence, changes in functional diversity and functional redundancy in ecosystems closely relate to long-term vulnerability changes in the system (e.g., a reduction in functional diversity may lead to a higher vulnerable state of that system in the long-term).
