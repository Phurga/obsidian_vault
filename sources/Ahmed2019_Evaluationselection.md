>[!abstract]-
>In life cycle assessments (LCAs), the focus of modelling the impact of human-induced pressures on biodiversity has been mainly on taxonomic diversity measures such as species richness. More recently, increasing availability of trait data and the understanding that functional diversity is more directly related to human-induced pressures suggests functional diversity as a promising metric. One major challenge relates to the selection process of the correct metric. Our purpose is to categorise and identify appropriate metrics of functional diversity for LCA model developers based on a justified choice of its structural properties and its links to human-induced pressures.

Review of functional diversity metrics in LCA

Contextualize biodiv approch alternative to land use to species richness approaches
Not really ? More an approach to challenge species richness and go to [[species trait]] richness, but still linking with human pressures such as [[land use|LULUC]]

> The vast majority of LCIA approaches look at biodiversity impacts by land use and land use change only. An important milestone was the publication of a special issue of this journal on Global land use impacts on biodiversity and [[ecosystem service]] in LCA that included a.o. papers on related UNEP-SETAC guidelines (Koellner et al. 2013), land use impacts on biotic production (BrandaÌƒo et al. 2013; compare Taelman et al. 2016), land use  impacts on ecosystem services like freshwater and erosion regulation (Saad et al. 2013) and **land use impacts on functional diversity (De Souza et al. 2013).** Approaches which analyse the impacts of land use occupation and change on [[species abudance]] or [[species richness]], usually by applying species-area relationships ([[species-area relationship|SAR]]s) are however dominating the current state of the art in LCIA. Recent examples of studies presenting such indicators include de Baan et al. (2014), [[Chaudhary2015_QuantifyingLand]] and Wilting et al. (2017). 

> In the case of non-land use impacts, the link between species richness and anthropogenic influences is weak at best.

traditional biod measures : [[species richness]], [[phylogenetic diversity]]
emerging (2011) [[functional diversity]]
> functional diversity i.e. the diversity of plant species traits in ecosystems

species traits: plants: leaf area, rooting depth ... animals: body size, respiration rate...

> functional diversity is one of the best predictors of ecosystem functioning that is available (...) that it is not the number of species but the number of traits that directly relates to ecosystem functioning

- [[MaiaDeSouza2013_Landuse]] integrates a functional diversity metric, but data availability limited its use to america
- no consensus on a metric to link invetory with FD
- analogy with richness: 
	- you start from inventories of species under given states (eg natural land use and arable land) and derive richness (amount of species) for each state, and get PDF from the difference between the two states.
	- here you start from inventories of species and their traits under given states, derive FD metric (eg [[functional eveness]]) for each state, and get change between the two states
- there are many possible FD metrics, the main 3 ones, to use combined are:
	- ![[functional richness|FD richness]]
	- ![[functional eveness|FD eveness]]
	- ![[functional divergence|FD divergence]]
![[Ahmed2019_Evaluationselection_FD_metrics.png]]
![[Villeger2008_NewMultidimensional_FD_metrics.png]]

- studies focus on plants because of data availability (see Scherer et al 2020)

> Most studies (using FD to measure human pressure on biodiv) do not provide a convincing justification and do not quantify the strength of the relationship between functional diversity metrics and human-induced pressures.
