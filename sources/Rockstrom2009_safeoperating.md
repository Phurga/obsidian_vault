>From an Earth-system perspective, setting a boundary for biodiversity is difficult. Although it is now accepted that a rich mix of species underpins the resilience of ecosystems[20](https://www.nature.com/articles/461472a#ref-CR20 "Folke, C. et al. Annu. Rev. Ecol. Evol. Syst. 35, 557–581 (2004)."),[21](https://www.nature.com/articles/461472a#ref-CR21 "Chapin, F. S., III et al. Nature 405, 234–242 (2000)."), little is known quantitatively about how much and what kinds of biodiversity can be lost before this resilience is eroded[22](https://www.nature.com/articles/461472a#ref-CR22 "Purvis, A. & Hector, A. Nature 405, 212–219 (2000)."). This is particularly true at the scale of Earth as a whole, or for major subsystems such as the Borneo rainforests or the Amazon Basin. Ideally, a planetary boundary should capture the role of biodiversity in regulating the resilience of systems on Earth. Because science cannot yet provide such information at an aggregate level, we propose extinction rate as an alternative (but weaker) indicator. As a result, our suggested planetary boundary for biodiversity of ten times the background rates of extinction is only a very preliminary estimate. More research is required to pin down this boundary with greater certainty. However, we can say with some confidence that Earth cannot sustain the current rate of loss without significant erosion of ecosystem resilience.
