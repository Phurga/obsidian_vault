>Factors driving microbial community composition and diversity are well established but the relationship with microbial functioning is poorly understood, especially at large scales. We analysed microbial biodiversity metrics and distribution of potential functional groups along a gradient of increasing land-use perturbation, detecting over 79,000 bacterial and 25,000 fungal OTUs in 715 sites across 24 European countries. We found the lowest bacterial and fungal diversity in less-disturbed environments (woodlands) compared to grasslands and highly-disturbed environments (croplands). Highly-disturbed environments contain significantly more bacterial chemoheterotrophs, harbour a higher proportion of fungal plant pathogens and saprotrophs, and have less beneficial fungal plant symbionts compared to woodlands and extensively-managed grasslands. Spatial patterns of microbial communities and predicted functions are best explained when interactions among the major determinants (vegetation cover, climate, soil properties) are considered. We propose guidelines for environmental policy actions and argue that taxonomical and functional diversity should be considered simultaneously for monitoring purposes.

Use of [[beta diversity]] as indicator for community structure.
Use of [[shannon index]] as indicator for diversity (but i seems it is better suited with eveness)

Finds an increase in microbial richness in managed land vs in natural land (forests).
> Higher microbial richness and diversity in croplands and grassland compared to woodlands might result from increased niche availability at the local scale due to either soil perturbation or the presence of a heterogeneous environment with different plant species (e.g. in grasslands or when different crops are rotated in arable and vegetable fields).

>future studies should compare multiple sampling points within the same location, in order to account for micro-scale variability of the biota (i.e. changes over distances of few metres)

Decoupling function and taxonomy in the global ocean microbiome. Science 353, 1272–1277 (2016).") and FungalTraits[97](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-37937-4#ref-CR97 "Põlme, S. et al. FungalTraits: a user-friendly traits database of fungi and fungus-like stramenopiles. Fungal Diversity 105, 1–16 (2020).") were used to associate potential functions to bacterial zOTUs and fungal OTUs based on their taxonomy. Taxonomically unannotated bacterial zOTUs and fungal OTUs were not associated to any function and left as unknowns. For bacteria, FAPROTAX confidently associates a function to zOTUs identified at family, genus or species levels (i.e. a zOTU identified down to the order level is usually ignored by FAPROTAX, see the _Instructions_ section on [http://www.loucalab.com](http://www.loucalab.com)). For fungi, as described in Tedersoo et al.[7](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-37937-4#ref-CR7 "Hunt, H. W. & Wall, D. H. Modelling the effects of loss of soil biodiversity on ecosystem function: BIODIVERSITY and ECOSYSTEM FUNCTION. Glob. Change Biol. 8, 33–50 (2002)."), functional annotation of OTUs was performed at the level of genera for most fungal guilds.
