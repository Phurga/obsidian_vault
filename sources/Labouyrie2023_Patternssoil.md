>Factors driving microbial community composition and diversity are well established but the relationship with microbial functioning is poorly understood, especially at large scales. We analysed microbial biodiversity metrics and distribution of potential functional groups along a gradient of increasing land-use perturbation, detecting over 79,000 bacterial and 25,000 fungal OTUs in 715 sites across 24 European countries. We found the lowest bacterial and fungal diversity in less-disturbed environments (woodlands) compared to grasslands and highly-disturbed environments (croplands). Highly-disturbed environments contain significantly more bacterial chemoheterotrophs, harbour a higher proportion of fungal plant pathogens and saprotrophs, and have less beneficial fungal plant symbionts compared to woodlands and extensively-managed grasslands. Spatial patterns of microbial communities and predicted functions are best explained when interactions among the major determinants (vegetation cover, climate, soil properties) are considered. We propose guidelines for environmental policy actions and argue that taxonomical and functional diversity should be considered simultaneously for monitoring purposes.

Use of [[operational taxonomic unit|OTU]] and [[DNA metabarcoding]]
Uses [[LUCAS]]
Definition of a land-use perturbation gradient (related to [[land use intensity]]).
Extended documentation on effects of perturbations of environmental conditions (direct human or indirect such as climate change) on soil microrganisms communities.

Use of [[beta diversity]] as indicator for community structure.
Use of [[shannon index]] as indicator for diversity (but i seems it is better suited with eveness)

Finds an increase in microbial richness in managed land vs in natural land (forests).
> Higher microbial richness and diversity in croplands and grassland compared to woodlands might result from increased niche availability at the local scale due to either soil perturbation or the presence of a heterogeneous environment with different plant species (e.g. in grasslands or when different crops are rotated in arable and vegetable fields).

>future studies should compare multiple sampling points within the same location, in order to account for micro-scale variability of the biota (i.e. changes over distances of few metres)
