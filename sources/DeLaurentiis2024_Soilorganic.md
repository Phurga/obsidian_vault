>Purpose Anthropogenic activities are a major driver of soil and land degradation. Due to the spatial heterogeneity of soil properties and the global nature of most value chains, the modelling of the impacts of land use on soil quality for application in life cycle assessment (LCA) requires a regionalised assessment with global coverage. This paper proposes an approach to quantify the impacts of land use on soil quality, using changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks as a proxy, following the latest recommendation of the Life Cycle Initiative.
Methods An operational set of SOC-based characterisation factors for land occupation and land transformation were derived using spatial datasets (1 km resolution) and aggregated at the national and global levels. The developed characterisation factors were tested by means of a case study analysis, investigating the impact on soil quality caused by land use activities necessary to provide three alternative energy supply systems for passenger car transport (biomethane, ethanol, and solar electricity). Results obtained by applying characterisation factors at local, regional, and national levels were compared, to investigate the role of the level of regionalisation on the resulting impacts.
Results and discussion Global maps of characterisation factors are presented for the 56 land use types commonly used in LCA databases, together with national and global values. Urban and industrial land uses present the highest impacts on SOC stocks, followed by severely degraded pastures and intensively managed arable lands. Instead, values obtained for extensive pastures, flooded crops, and urban green areas often report an increase in SOC stocks. Results show that the ranking of impacts of the three energy systems considered in the case study analysis is not affected by the level of regionalisation of the analysis. In the case of biomethane energy supply, impacts assessed using national characterisation factors are more than double those obtained with local characterisation factors, with less significant differences in the other two cases.
Conclusions The integration of soil quality aspects in life cycle impact assessment methods is a crucial challenge due to the key role of soil conservation in ensuring food security and environmental protection. This approach allows the quantification of land use impacts on SOC stocks, taken as a proxy of soil quality. Further research needs to improve the assessment of land use impacts in LCA are identified, such as the ability to reflect the effects of agricultural and forestry management practices.

reference situation
> The SOC stock of the reference situation is defined as the one present in native lands, such as non-degraded, unim- proved lands under native vegetation (defined in Koellner et al. (2013b) as the quasi-natural land cover predominant in global biomes and ecoregions). 

Rationale of choice
>This paper proposes an approach to quantify the impacts of land use on soil quality, using changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks as a proxy, following the latest recommendation of the Life Cycle Initiative.

Practices:
> Further research needs to improve the assessment of land use impacts in LCA are identified, such as the ability to reflect the effects of agricultural and forestry management practices.

History:
> Existing models, developed to account for impacts of land use activities on soil quality, addressed the following degradation processes:
	- decline in soil organic matter (SOM) (Milà i Canals et al. 2007a, b) or 
	- soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks (Brandão and Milà i Canals 2013), (**THIS IS THE FOLLOW UP**)
	- soil erosion (Bos et al. 2016; Núñez et al. 2013; Sonderegger et al. 2020), 
	- salinisation (Payen et al. 2014), 
	- soil compaction (Sonderegger et al. 2020), 
	- reduction in groundwater regeneration potential, and mechanical and physicochemical filtration potential (included in the multi-indicator LANd use indicator value  CAlculation (LANCA®) model (Bos et al. 2016; Saad et al.  2013).

[[conflict land use classes IPCC and GLAM]]

Limitations for [[agricultural practices]] ([[soil organic matter#SOM as an indicator]]).
Same for forestry (all forestry has 0 impacts on soils with IPCC T1).
**Needs further work to refine IPCC caluclations to practices on forestry and non conventional farming.**
