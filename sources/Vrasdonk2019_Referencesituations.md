>[!abstract]-
>In life cycle assessment (LCA) literature addressing land use impacts on biodiversity, several potential reference situations are proposed. However, the lack of guidance on how to apply the proposed reference situations fosters confusion within the topic and raises questions about implications of different reference conceptions. The purpose of this article is to contribute to an improved methodology for assessing biodiversity impacts in LCA through developing the use of reference situations in life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) models of land use.

Consolidated in [[reference situation]].
### living in harmony with nature instead of naturalness
> For example, the global Convention on Biodiversity (CBD) which is based on the vision "Living in Harmony with Nature" does not aim predominantly at naturalness but emphasizes the sustainable coexistence of humans and biodiversity by stating that BBy 2050, biodiversity is valued, conserved, restored and wisely used, maintaining ecosystem services, sustaining a healthy planet and delivering benefits essential for all people^ (UN CBD 2010, p. 8).
### very old reference situations are not helpful
> When using historical baseline references, usually a point in time is selected to compare against current conditions to. Without a sufficiently distant past, however, these references may fail to fully inform about past human impacts. Choosing a timeframe is therefore not straightforward; how far back in time do we have to go? Obviously, going back to times in which the wooly mammoth was still around, some 10,000 years ago, would not appear be relevant for current assessments of current land use impacts, but identifying a closer pristine nature time period might be challenging, as human land use history varies strongly from region to region (e.g., Hilding Rydevik et al. 2018). To be able to compare impacts of land use in different landscapes, time frame and level of degradation of the reference should be equal, if not to be compromised (Nielsen et al. 2007).

### need for counterfactual
> the effect of land interventions on biodiversity can only be explained if the expected trends of biodiversity in the absence of these interventions are known, thus if a natural counterfactual reference situation is used.
### potential natural vegetation is not counterfactual
> PNV is a re-naturalization reference rather than a natural counterfactual reference situation.

Biodiversity loss measurement is a wicked problem and there is no objective measure for the impacts on biodiversity loss, only measures of deviations from conservation targets.
> it is necessary to define reference situations that reflect favorable conservation status and sustainable use of each specific type of biodiversity, some of which may be characterized by naturalness, others by human land-use. In this way, the reference situation is used to facilitate a distance to target measure, which can be justified if we do not only aim to conserve diversity of wild species but also of their cultivated, farmed, and domesticated relatives as well as other socioeconomically and culturally valuable species.
> (...) assessing impacts against historical ecosystem processes and cultural landscapes in a manner that **accounts for long-term human occupancy rather than supposedly pristine landscapes**.

I need to understand this sentence.
> The application of a baseline reference situation provides favorable conservation status only for species in those habitats that have the highest ecological functionality in the absence of human impact, for example, some habitats in old-growth forest, high alpine and mire ecosystems, and most aquatic ecosystems

> The current LULUC framework from UNEP-SETAC might not support distance to target measures for biodiversity.

LCIA methods vs conservation frameworks
> **conservation frameworks aim to preserve ecologically functioning ecosystems of which many depend on continued sustainable human use of their biodiversity**
> 	Given the role of LCA in decision-making, it is of importance that impact assessment models address biodiversity impacts in a way that make the assessment compatible with current conservation strategies and policies, and produce results that can be translated into trends for indicators used in conservation. In contrast to the majority of LCIA models for biodiversity proposed until now, conservation frameworks aim to preserve ecologically functioning ecosystems of which many depend on continued sustainable human use of their biodiversity.
