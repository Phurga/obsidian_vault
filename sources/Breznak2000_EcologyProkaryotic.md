>[!abstract]-
>The gut of wood- and litter-feeding termites harbors a dense and diverse community of prokaryotes that contribute to the carbon, nitrogen and energy requirements of the insects. Acetogenesis from H2 plus CO2 by hindgut prokaryotes supports up to 1/3 of the respiratory requirement of some termite species; and N2-fixing and uric acid-degrading microbes can have a significant impact on termite N economy. Microelectrode studies reveal that hindguts consist of an anoxic lumen surrounded by a microoxic periphery — a finding consistent with the occurrence of both anaerobic and O2-dependent microbial metabolism in hindguts. They also suggest that the enigmatic dominance of acetogens over methanogens as an H2 “sink” reflects a spatial separation of these H2-consuming populations, with the former being closer to sources of H2 production. Isolation of a number of the prokaryotes (including spirochetes, which have proven to be H2/CO2-acetogens) reveals that termite guts are a source of novel microbial diversity. However, molecular biological analyses indicate that much of that diversity is still poorly represented in culture.
