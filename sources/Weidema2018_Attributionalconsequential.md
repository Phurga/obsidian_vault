>Results of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) are critically dependent on the system boundaries, notably the choice of attributional or consequential modelling. Published LCA studies rarely specify and justify their modelling choices. Since LCA studies are typically performed within the context of social responsibility and product life cycle management, this article investigates the relationship between social responsibility paradigms and the system modelling choices in LCA. We identify three different social responsibility paradigms: Value chain responsibility, Supply chain responsibility and Consequential responsibility. We point out that while there is no generally right or wrong choice of system model, each responsibility paradigm implies a speciﬁc matching system model. We then argue that all responsibility paradigms ultimately imply a consequential perspective, namely that of responding to the concerns of the system stakeholders. Although value or supply chains are systems deﬁned without concern for consequences, and thus may include activities that the decision maker cannot inﬂuence, the chosen system is still analysed and assessed by accounting for its social consequences, and it is for these consequences that social responsibility is then taken. We argue that it is inconsistent to exclude consequences of own actions (i.e. the consequential system) while including consequences from actions of others in value chain or supply chain. We thus conclude that a consistent socially responsible decisionmaker must always take responsibility for the activities in the consequential product life cycle and may additionally take responsibility for the consequences of other activities in the value chain or supply chain. We end the article with recommendations on reporting on LCA system models that are more speciﬁc than those of the current LCA standards.

### attributional vs consequential
Attributional LCA aims at estimating the impacts of a product based on a value chain responsibility paradigm. If one considers the total impacts of the global economy, attributional LCA will attempt to attribute a share of these impacts to the studied system based on direct relationships with the system (with allocation rules for multifunctional processes). For this reason attributional LCA is widespread in contexts where the goal is to measure and attribute impacts to a product or an organisation, i.e. environmental footprinting.
Consequential LCA aims at estimating the change in impacts derived from a decision. The decision being for instance the use of a specific (new) product. It would not only consider the production impacts of the product, but also side effects related to the introduction of the product. Important side effects are market effects: increased production of product A might lead to decreased production of product B, or induce rebound effects increasing consumption of A or a third linked product C. For instance in [[Schmidt2015_LifeCycle]], esp. section 2.3.

Properly defined in [[Sonnemann2011_GlobalGuidance]]:
- Attributional approach: System modelling approach in which inputs and outputs are attributed to the functional unit of a product system by linking and/or partitioning the unit processes of the system according to a normative rule. 
- Consequential approach: System modelling approach in which activities in a product system are linked so that activities are included in the product system to the extent that they are expected to change as a consequence of a change in demand for the functional unit.
### question answered by consequential
Consequential LCA tries to solve the issue of the normative partitioning of multifunctional processes (through elaborate system expansion) and integrate side effects such as rebound effects towards results that are closer to the socio economic context of the study. They are best used when trying to answer a question such as "what is the effect of increasing the consumption of x ?"
### marginal vs incremental
Marginal consequential LCA vs incremental consequential LCA: by default consequential LCA are marginal, meaning that they account for small changes of markets (eg substitution of a product leads solely to the decrease in production of the substituted product). Incremental LCA stand for large scale changes where the whole economy is affected, leading to increased changes. Modeling choices are in this case different.
