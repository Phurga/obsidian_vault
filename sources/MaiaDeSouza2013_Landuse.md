>[!abstract]-
>The focus of land use modeling in life cycle impact assessment has been mainly on taxonomic measures of biodiversity, namely species richness (SR). However, increasing availability of trait data for species has led to the use of functional diversity (FD) as a promising metric to reflect the distinctiveness of species; this paper proposes the use of an FD index to calculate characterization factors (CFs) for land use impacts. Furthermore, we compare the results of the CFs to current practice and assess the increase in complexity introduced by the use of the new indicator.

%% begin notes %% 

This is the first LCIA method that derive CFs for functional diversity, before Scherer in 2020.

Taxon covered: plant, mammals, birds.
Geographical coverage: Americas
Following Petchey 2002 (Functional diversity (FD), species richness and community composition) calculation rules for FD index.

> The increasing availability of data sets on species  composition, (splot 2019) species traits,(TRY 2011) and global trait patterns (2014) allow a much more detailed understanding of functional diversity patterns than feasible a few years ago.
