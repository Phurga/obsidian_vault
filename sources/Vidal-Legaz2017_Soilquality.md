>[!abstract]-
>Soils provide essential ecosystem services for supporting both human and ecosystem needs and has been under pressures resulting from the intensiﬁcation and expansion of human activities. In the last 15 years, substantial efforts have been made to quantify the impacts on soils derived from production systems and their related supply chains. In this study, a systematic, qualitative evaluation of up-to-date models connecting land occupation and land transformation to soil impact indicators (e.g., soil properties, functions, and threats) is performed. The focus is on models that may be applied for assessing supply chains, namely in the context of life cycle assessment (LCA). A range of eleven soil-related models was selected and evaluated against different criteria, including scientiﬁc soundness, stakeholders' acceptance, reproducibility, and the applicability of models from the perspective of LCA practitioners. Additionally, this study proposes a new land use cause-effect chain to qualify the impacts of land use on soils. None of the models is fulﬁlling all the criteria and includes comprehensively the cause-effect impact pathways. Notably, trade-offs were most frequent between the relevance of the modeled impact processes and the models' applicability. On the one hand, models proposing multi-indicators cover several drivers of impacts and have a broader scope. On the other hand, several models just focus on one driver of impact, but may provide more relevant impact characterization. Our results provide common ground for the development and identiﬁcation of models that provide a comprehensive and robust assessment of land use change and land use impacts on soils. Indeed, to ensure both a comprehensive and relevant characterization of impacts, the study identiﬁes several research needs for further models' developments, namely: 1) adopting a common land use cause-effect chain and land use classiﬁcation; 2) accounting for different land management and land use intensities; 3) expanding the inventory data beyond the accounting of the area related to a certain land use; 4) assessing the added value of multi-indicators compared to single indicators, including the reduction of possible redundancies in the impact evaluation; 5) improving consistency from midpoint to endpoint characterization, especially the link with biodiversity; 6) guiding the calculation of normalization factors; and 7) assessing systematically model's uncertainty.

### soil quality
> Soil quality is defined as the “capacity of a living soil to: function,  within natural or managed ecosystem boundaries; to sustain plant and animal productivity; to maintain or enhance water and air quality; and to promote plant and animal health”.
### soil degradation
> A report on the status of world's soil resources (FAO, 2015) shows the majority of soils are in fair, poor, or very poor conditions. Some of the most worrisome conditions are characterized by advanced degrees of erosion, leading to crop losses, and increased soil acidity with a lack of soil nutrients, constraining food production (Blum, 2005; Menon et al., 2014).
> The trend towards soil degradation is expected to continue, with projected increases in livestock production (Bouwman et al., 2013), deforestation rates, poor water and nutrient management, and large-scale applications of pesticides (FAO and ITPS, 2015).

### [[LCIA method on soil quality]]
> three main quantitative approaches to the land footprinting, i.e. the impact assessment of human pressures on land, were identified: 
> 1) mere land accounting, which reports the area of land use associated with certain activities/crops (e.g. expressed in m2); 
> 2) weighted accounting, which estimates the amount of land standardized to factors as the productivity of the land, e.g., the ecological footprint (Wackernagel, 2014); and 
> 3) the quantification of the change of a specific soil feature resulting from land interventions, e.g., soil organic matter (Mila i Canals et al., 2007a, 2007b)
### soil is complex
> quantifying impacts on soil functions is challenging given the complexity of soil processes and the spatial and temporal variability of soil properties (Lauber et al., 2013; Vereecken et al., 2014). Accounting for this variability determines the adequacy of a soil quality model to represent local conditions (Doran and Parkin, 1996).
### soil quality, biodiversity and fertility
> According to UNEP-SETAC, land use models should focus both on soil quality, biotic production, and biodiversity.
### land use classification
> harmonized classification of land use/ cover types (Koellner et al., 2013b) to guarantee a better coverage of land use typologies and improve the comparability of modeling results.

### current issues on soil quality models
> - First, a clear and consistent cause-effect chain, also called impact pathway, is still missing. The impact pathway should depict systematically the causal relationships from the inventory data (amount and typology of land use) to the mid- and endpoint indicators and areas of protection.
> - Second, current models that could be applicable in LCA are unable to comprehensively depict the multiple impacts derived from land use and land use change.
> - Moreover, many of these models are originally based on site specific studies (and data) and require additional effort for their adaptation to other locations and spatial scales.
> - Finally, the reference state used to assess the potential environmental impacts often differs among models, making results incomparable.
