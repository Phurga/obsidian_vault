>[!abstract]-
>As the United Nations develops a post-2020 global biodiversity framework for the Convention on Biological Diversity, attention is focusing on how new goals and targets for ecosystem conservation might serve its vision of ‘living in harmony with nature’1,2. Advancing dual imperatives to conserve biodiversity and sustain ecosystem services requires reliable and resilient generalizations and predictions about ecosystem responses to environmental change and management3. Ecosystems vary in their biota4, service provision5 and relative exposure to risks6, yet there is no globally consistent classification of ecosystems that reflects functional responses to change and management. This hampers progress on developing conservation targets and sustainability goals. Here we present the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Global Ecosystem Typology, a conceptually robust, scalable, spatially explicit approach for generalizations and predictions about functions, biota, risks and management remedies across the entire biosphere. The outcome of a major cross-disciplinary collaboration, this novel framework places all of Earth’s ecosystems into a unifying theoretical context to guide the transformation of ecosystem policy and management from global to local scales. This new information infrastructure will support knowledge transfer for ecosystem-specific management and restoration, globally standardized ecosystem risk assessments, natural capital accounting and progress on the post-2020 global biodiversity framework.

>Together with ecosystem function, the identity of constituent biota is central to biodiversity concepts, conservation goals and human values[10](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05318-4#ref-CR10 "Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011–2020 and the Aichi Targets ‘Living in Harmony with Nature’ (United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity, 2010)."). Although ecosystem functions and ecological processes support both the diversity of biota and human well-being, global assessments of ecosystems[11](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05318-4#ref-CR11 "Millennium Ecosystem Assessment. Ecosystems and Human Well-Being: Synthesis (Island Press, 2005)."),[12](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05318-4#ref-CR12 "Díaz, S. et al. Summary for Policymakers of the Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (Intergovernmental Panel on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, 2019).") continue to rely heavily on species metrics or simplistic land-cover proxies that convey limited information about ecosystems themselves. This limits our ability to diagnose trends and to design and resource on-ground management and policy solutions for slowing and reversing current declines in biodiversity and ecosystem services.
