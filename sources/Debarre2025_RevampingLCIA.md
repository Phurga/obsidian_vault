>Purpose. The integration of ecosystem services into the impact assessment phase, through the development of characterization models and factors that reflect potential impacts on ecosystems’ capacity to provide services, is gaining momentum within the life cycle assessment community. Progress remains limited due to the absence of a clear, standardized methodology for developing ecosystem services-related characterization models. A consistent life cycle impact assessment framework to support such integration is lacking. This research posits that ecosystem services concepts are already implicitly embedded within existing life cycle impact assessment models. To clarify their role and offer a consistent, structured basis for future model developments, this work proposes a revamped life cycle impact assessment framework through the lens of ecosystem services.

[[intrinsic value of nature]] (annex A)
> The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) defines ’intrinsic values’ as ’the value inherent to na- ture, independent of human experience and evaluation, and thus beyond the scope of anthropocentric valuation approaches’ (Díaz et al., 2015, 2018). The latter part of the definition (i.e., ’beyond the scope of anthropocentric valuation approaches’) suggests that intrinsic values cannot be quantified. In this respect, the development of impact scores to assess quantified impacts on intrinsic values is subject to debate.
