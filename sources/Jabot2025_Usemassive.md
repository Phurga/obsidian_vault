>[!abstract]-
>Biodiversity monitoring primarily focuses on particular taxonomic groups for which identification expertise is widely available, such as vascular plants or birds. As a result, the response of many taxonomic groups to forest management is much less documented. With the advent of low-cost next generation barcoding approaches, it is now possible to envisage monitoring strategies based on molecular approaches, beyond metabarcoding/eDNA strategies that do not give access to species abundances and integrate species presence over largely unknown spatio-temporal scales. In this contribution, we demonstrate the use of massive DNA barcoding – also referred as megabarcoding – as a promising solution to overcome identification difficulties in demanding taxonomic groups. We performed a proof of concept study in a mountainous beech forest in the Massif Central, France. We sampled soil macrofauna at 25 sampling sites and managed to visually identify at the species level 130 out of the 1413 sampled individuals. Using megabarcoding on the 1283 remaining non-identified individuals, we managed to assign 1124 additional individuals to an operational taxonomic species at a competitive cost. We present the summary statistics of barcoding success in the different taxonomic groups encountered and in larvae versus adult individuals. We demonstrate that larvae individuals, which can hardly be visually identified at the species level, make a substantial contribution to overall macrofauna diversity. We finally showcase how this megabarcoding approach provides a concrete avenue for forest biodiversity monitoring, by assessing the cost and labour intensity of this approach.
