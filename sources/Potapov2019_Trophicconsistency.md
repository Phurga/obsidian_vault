>Organisms of the same species usually share morphology and have similar feeding habits. By contrast, different species typically differ in morphology and feed on different food sources. However, morphological differences among species vary strongly– some species look very similar, whereas others are distinct. Morphologically similar species are combined to higher taxonomic groups that form a consistent hierarchical system – species are grouped to genera, genera to families etc. The fundamental question we ask in our study is, does the classification of organisms based on morphological differences explain variations in their feeding habits? Essentially this asks, if two organisms look different, do they also eat different things? Soil and dead material on its surface (plant litter) are inhabited by a huge diversity of organisms, challenging studies on their morphological and trophic variability. We focused on several ancient evolutionary lineages of invertebrates including insects, mites, spiders, myriapods, woodlice and earthworms. To get insight into their feeding habits, we used stable isotope analysis of animal tissue, that provides information on the diet over last weeks, months or even years without direct observations of animal feeding interactions, which is indeed difficult in soil. We found that differences in the feeding habits among organisms are related to morphological differences between them (as reflected by taxonomic groups). More than 50% of the variation in the trophic position of animals was explained by the differences among very broad groups, such as classes and orders, that encompass thousands of species. We also showed that trophic niches within taxonomic groups are “consistent”, i.e. feeding habits of species within taxonomic groups are similar. Interestingly, more diverse taxonomic groups also were more variable in their feeding habits reflecting a link between diversification in morphology and feeding habits during the life history. Our study pushes forward the understanding of cryptic belowground communities, and facilitates modelling and predicting their response to global and local changes.

supraspecific taxa: taxa larger than species.
paper observes that species with similar morphology tend to be in similar trophic groups, not so important
