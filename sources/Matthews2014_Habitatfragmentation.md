>Aim The species–area relationship (SAR) is widely used in conservation science to predict the number of species likely to go extinct as a result of habitat loss. Often, studies employing the SAR use total species richness as the dependent variable. However, this overlooks the fact that habitat specialists and generalists differ in their susceptibility to habitat loss. We undertook a synthetic review of 23 habitat island datasets for birds to determine the impact of habitat generalists on the SAR.
