>Land use for agriculture is one of the main drivers of biodiversity loss. While there are valuable LCIA methods for biodiversity, they do not take account for impacts at different spatial scales and face challenges in software and database integration. This study reports on a new Biodiversity Multi-scale Assessment (BioMAss) method. Goal is to describe the calculation procedure and to show the methodological approach exemplarily for the land use type cropland.
