>[!abstract]-
>DNA barcoding is a powerful taxonomic tool to identify and discover species. DNA barcoding utilizes one or more standardized short DNA regions for taxon identification. With the emergence of new sequencing techniques, such as Next-generation sequencing (NGS), ONT MinION nanopore sequencing, and Pac Bio sequencing, DNA barcoding has become more accurate, fast, and reliable. Rapid species identification by DNA barcodes has been used in a variety of fields, including forensic science, control of the food supply chain, and disease understanding. The Consortium for Barcode of Life (CBOL) presents various working groups to identify the universal barcode gene, such as COI in metazoans; rbcL, matK, and ITS in plants; ITS in fungi; 16S rRNA gene in bacteria and archaea, and creating a reference DNA barcode library. In this article, an attempt has been made to analyze the various proposed DNA barcode for different organisms, strengths & limitations, recent advancements in DNA barcoding, and methods to speed up the DNA barcode reference library construction. This study concludes that constructing a reference library with high species coverage would be a major step toward identifying species by DNA barcodes. This can be achieved in a short period of time by using advanced sequencing and data analysis methods.

## Reference library construction
> BOLD is the largest reference library or database and its growth has been exponential over the last decades.

> The International Barcode of Life Consortium (iBOL) launches several projects to expand the DNA barcode reference library or database, including 500K (completed in 2015), BIOSCAN (launched in 2019), and the Earth Biogenome Project.

> Constructing a reference library with extensive species coverage presents several challenges. The first challenge is the high expense of collecting raw data, which can be accomplished through DNA sequencing.

> The majority of current work on DNA barcoding has been done in Europe and North America, which could be another reason for the limited reference library/database.

> DNA barcoding approach is also widely used by ecologist due to several reasons. 
>  - First, the diversity of ecologically essential life forms such as ciliates and nematodes are mostly unknown and the DNA barcoding approach is a better way to assess the biodiversity of such life forms.
>  - Second, DNA barcode can also detect endangered species from hair and faeces sample left behind by animals [57]. 
>  - Third, illegal trade in animal by-product can be monitored with the help of DNA barcoding technique [93]. 
>  - Fourth, DNA barcoding can be advantageous in the field of biosecurity.

## Drawbacks
> One of the most significant drawbacks of the DNA barcoding method is that there is no universal primer or universal gene found in all forms of life and has enough sequence divergence to allow for species differentiation.

> DNA barcoding distinguishes species based on intraspecific and interspecific genetic variation, although the ranges of such variation are unclear and may differ between taxa
