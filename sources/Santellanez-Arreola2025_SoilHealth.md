>Conservation agriculture (CA) is a sustainable land management approach to improve soil quality while mitigating degradation. Although extensive information regarding the effect of CA on soil properties and microbiome is available, complete studies on the cumulative effect on specific interactions between soil parameters, crop productivity, and microbial communities over time are still lacking, mainly in arid regions. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the effects of no-tillage and residue retention over long- and short-term (24 and 3 years, respectively) periods. Six treatments were established in a maize–oat–triticale system from 1995 in a semiarid region: P + H—plow + harrow; H—harrow; MP—multi-plow (short-term); NT—no-tillage; NT33—NT + 33% residue surface cover (long-term); NT66—NT + 66% residue surface cover. Results indicated that CA improved soil quality by increasing soil organic matter (SOM), total carbon, and glomalin; it also enhanced microbial abundance, particularly fungi, and β-galactosidase activity. Nevertheless, conventional tillage practices led to SOM degradation and reduced crop yields. Principal component analysis revealed distinct groupings of treatments based on soil properties and microbial communities. Furthermore, changes could be detected from the short term. These findings highlight the importance of adopting sustainable agricultural practices to maintain soil health and ensure agricultural productivity in semi-arid regions.
