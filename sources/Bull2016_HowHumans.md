>[!abstract]-
>A central topic for conservation science is evaluating how human activities influence global species diversity. Humanity exacerbates extinction rates. But by what mechanisms does humanity drive the emergence of new species? We review human-mediated speciation, compare speciation and known extinctions, and discuss the challenges of using net species diversity as a conservation objective. Humans drive rapid evolution through relocation, domestication, hunting and novel ecosystem creation—and emerging technologies could eventually provide additional mechanisms. The number of species relocated, domesticated and hunted during the Holocene is of comparable magnitude to the number of observed extinctions. While instances of human-mediated speciation are known, the overall effect these mechanisms have upon speciation rates has not yet been quantified. We also explore the importance of anthropogenic influence upon divergence in microorganisms. Even if human activities resulted in no net loss of species diversity by balancing speciation and extinction rates, this would probably be deemed unacceptable. We discuss why, based upon ‘no net loss’ conservation literature—considering phylogenetic diversity and other metrics, risk aversion, taboo trade-offs and spatial heterogeneity. We conclude that evaluating speciation alongside extinction could result in more nuanced understanding of biosphere trends, clarifying what it is we actually value about biodiversity.

### increased microbial diversity in urban waters
>(...) water contaminated by effluent in novel urban environments presents opportunities for rapid microbe diversification \[[87](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2016.0600#RSPB20160600C87)].

>As a species, human micro-biome diversity is greater than for our closest extant relatives (wild apes) \[[95](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2016.0600#RSPB20160600C95)]. Despite potential for homogenization through globalization, and loss of ancient human micro-biome assemblages, geographical variation in micro-biome genotypes is large \[[95](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2016.0600#RSPB20160600C95),[96](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2016.0600#RSPB20160600C96)].
### why are we not excited with speciation
>\[I]f humanity drove speciation as fast as extinction with a neutral net outcome for species diversity, would this be acceptable? If species numbers alone reflected our preferences, then species gains should temper concern about extinctions. Yet intuitively, the answer would likely be ‘no’, extinctions cannot acceptably be compensated for in this way. This answer has theoretical support in the literature concerning policies seeking neutral net biodiversity outcomes—the ‘no net loss’ principle \[[98](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2016.0600#RSPB20160600C98)].
