>[!abstract]-
>In this article, the authors propose an impact assessment method for life cycle assessment (LCA) that adheres to established LCA principles for land use-related impact assessment, bridges current research gaps and addresses the requirements of different stakeholders for a methodological framework. The conservation of biodiversity is a priority for humanity, as expressed in the framework of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Addressing biodiversity across value chains is a key challenge for enabling sustainable production pathways. Life cycle assessment is a standardised approach to assess and compare environmental impacts of products along their value chains. The impact assessment method presented in this article allows the quantification of the impact of land-using production processes on biodiversity for several broad land use classes. It provides a calculation framework with degrees of customisation (e.g., to take into account regional conservation priorities), but also offers a default valuation of biodiversity based on naturalness. The applicability of the method is demonstrated through an example of a consumer product. The main strength of the approach is that it yields highly aggregated information on the biodiversity impacts of products, enabling biodiversity-conscious decisions about raw materials, production routes and end user products.

> Defines the [[biodiversity value increment]], the main implementation of [[naturalness in LCIA]], which are methods for [[LCIA method for land use impacts on ecosystem quality]]. This is an improvement from [[distance to nature potential]], giving more granularity on the characterization factors derived from [[land management]] parameters.

Additional notes:
- the EF calculation seems subjective.
- the ordinal scales seem subjective (refining the classification will lead to important changes in the results)
- the approach using management practices is interesting, but comprehensiveness is debatable.
- it is said to cover genetic, species and ecosystem diversity, because the parameters values influence the ecosystem broadly and not target specific species, but this is debatable.
- I would not use it.
