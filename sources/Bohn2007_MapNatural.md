>[!abstract]-
>The Map of the Natural Vegetation of Europe was compiled and produced by an international team of leading geobotanists from 31 European countries over the period 1979 - 2003. The final results are available in printed and digital form, especially on an interactive CD-ROM with German and English texts. They include vegeta- tion maps at the scales of 1: 2.5 and 1: 10 million, a hierarchically structured overall legend, a comprehensive explanatory text, and standardized digital data sheets with detailed information on 699 mapping units. The digital database on CD-ROM facilitates a multitude of analyses and uses in the fields of research, teaching, information, and planning. Selected examples give a brief overview of the present application of the European map data. Thus the European vegetation map is very important for the development of a protected areas network in the Caucasus Ecoregion. Â© 2007 Bull. Georg. Natl. Acad. Sci.
