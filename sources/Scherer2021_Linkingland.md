>There is generally a mismatch in the land use classification of life cycle inventory (LCI) databases and life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) methods. This mismatch can hinder the proper assessment of land use impacts on biodiversity. To facilitate such assessments, we matched the land use classes of two global LCIA methods to five widely used LCI databases, one LCI nomenclature, and one multi-regional input–output database. In unclear cases, we assumed the worst case. Assumptions were especially necessary for unspecified land use intensity classes. We conclude with recommendations for LCI database and LCIA method developers.

> **Plantations, which refer to timber plantations**, are included in the LCIA method by Chaudhary and Brooks (2018:5094–5104. https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.7b05570")) but could not be linked to any elementary flow in the LCI databases, the nomenclature, or the environmentally extended MRIO database. We linked all forests to the characterization factors for managed forests. The standardized land use classification by Koellner et al. (2013a:1203–1215")) does also not distinguish between timber plantations and managed forests. Both Chaudhary and Brooks (2018:5094–5104. https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.7b05570")) and Koellner et al. (2013a:1203–1215")) consider **other plantations, e.g., for oil palm, under (permanent) crops**. **Agroforestry where trees or shrubs are mixed with crops and/or pasture on the same field are encoded in some databases as “agriculture, mosaic” or “heterogeneous, agricultural.”** They are also relevant as a land use class in LCIA methods because agroforestry can enhance biodiversity in an area compared to conventional agriculture or forestry (Torralba et al. 2016). In the standardized classification by Koellner et al. (2013a:1203–1215")), “agriculture, mosaic” also forms its own class and is not a subcategory of any other class.

> For LCI database developers, we recommend to:
> - make the inventory more specific wherever possible and avoid unspecified land use types or intensities, which are now penalized with assuming the worst case
> - do not offer occupation flows for natural land covers that are supposed to be without any use
> - **include only the net inventories for land transformation**
> - distinguish managed forests and timber plantations, as done in some LCIA methods
