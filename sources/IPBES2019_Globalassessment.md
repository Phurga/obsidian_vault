>IPBES is to perform regular and timely assessments of knowledge on biodiversity and ecosystem services and their interlinkages at the global level. Also addressing an invitation by the Conference of the Parties of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) to prepare a global assessment of biodiversity and ecosystem services building, inter alia, on its own and other relevant regional, subregional and thematic assessments, as well as on national reports. The overall scope of the assessment is to assess the status and trends with regard to biodiversity and ecosystem services, the impact of biodiversity and ecosystem services on human well-being and the effectiveness of responses, including the Strategic Plan and its Aichi Biodiversity Targets. It is anticipated that this deliverable will contribute to the process for the evaluation and renewal of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity and its Aichi Biodiversity Targets.

### multidimensionality of nature
>organising nature’s many dimensions into six classes – ecosystem structure, ecosystem function, community composition, species populations, organismal traits and genetic composition (Pereira et al., 2013) – and outlines how the global patterns of each today still largely reflects the action of natural evolutionary and ecological processes through earth’s history (Bowen et al., 2013; Pinheiro et al., 2017; Rex & Etter, 2010; Ricklefs, 2004; Whittaker et al., 2001; Willig et al., 2003).
### history of the report
> The CF explicitly recognizes rooting in the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (2003, 2005), its most immediate antecedent in terms of broad conceptual scope and intent.

### reading notes
[[habitat transformation|LUC]] is 30% of terrestrial [[biodiversity]] decline.
Direct exploitation, including [[soil quality]] degradation, is another 20%.

### human accelerates evolution
>Human-induced changes are creating conditions for fast biological evolution – so rapid that its effects can be seen in only a few years or even more quickly. The consequences can be positive or negative for biodiversity and ecosystems, but can create uncertainty about the sustainability of species, ecosystem functions and the delivery of nature’s contributions to people.
### human causes community homogeneisation
>Biological communities are becoming more similar to each other in both managed and unmanaged systems within and across regions.
