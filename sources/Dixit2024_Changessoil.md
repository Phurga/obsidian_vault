>Soil biological characteristics are drastically altered by land degradation. Degradation may reduce the number of microorganisms in the soil. Multiple activities and services provided by grassland ecosystems are impacted by land use change because of the resulting shifts in plant community composition and soil characteristics. A large body of research has examined the geographical and temporal dynamics of bacterial community structure and bacterial responses to human management in grassland ecosystems. As one of the most consequential environmental shifts occurring today, land use modification can affect microbial communities through modifying soil environmental parameters, nutritional conditions, and biological interactions. Whereas, soil microbes play crucial roles in nutrient cycling, organic matter decomposition, disease suppression, and overall soil health. Land degradation practices, such as deforestation, overgrazing, intensive agriculture, and improper land management, can disrupt the balance and diversity of soil microbial communities, leading to negative consequences for ecosystem functioning. To mitigate the negative effects of land degradation on soil microbial communities, sustainable land management practices should be adopted. These practices include soil conservation, reforestation, crop rotation, reduced tillage, organic farming methods, and proper nutrient management. By promoting soil health and restoring ecosystem processes, these approaches can help rebuild and maintain diverse and functional soil microbial communities. The purpose of this review is twofold: (1) to assess the diversity and composition of soil microorganisms in response to distinct land-use scenarios; and (2) to compare the relative importance of environmental factors driving these variations.
