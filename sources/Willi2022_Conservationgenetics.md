>[!abstract]-
>About 50 y ago, Crow and Kimura [An Introduction to Population Genetics Theory (1970)] and Ohta and Kimura [Genet. Res. 22, 201–204 (1973)] laid the foundations of conservation genetics by predicting the relationship between population size and genetic marker diversity. This work sparked an enormous research effort investigating the importance of population dynamics, in particular small population size, for population mean performance, population viability, and evolutionary potential. In light of a recent perspective [J. C. Teixeira, C. D. Huber, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 118, 10 (2021)] that challenges some fundamental assumptions in conservation genetics, it is timely to summarize what the field has achieved, what robust patterns have emerged, and worthwhile future research directions. We consider theory and methodological breakthroughs that have helped management, and we outline some fundamental and applied challenges for conservation genetics.

> Originally, Franklin ([72](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2105076119#core-r72)) proposed that an Ne of 500 is needed for an isolated population to retain evolutionary potential in the long run. This number was based on the equilibrium between new genetic variation arising from mutations and the loss of genetic variation from random genetic drift ([Fig. 2](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2105076119#fig02)), for traits that are relatively unaffected by selection or are subject to stabilizing selection. Revised recommendations (by considering differences in gene effects) suggest that an Ne above 1,000 is more realistic to sustain long-term viable populations ([73](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2105076119#core-r73)). As Ne is typically an order-of-magnitude lower than the census size, numbers may need to be above 10,000.
