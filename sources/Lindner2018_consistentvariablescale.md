>Impacts of land use on biodiversity are a current and relevant topic in the LCA community. Most existing methodsfor assessing biodiversity in LCA are either class-based or parameter-based. The class-based approach uses definedland use classes. For each class, an average value for biodiversity is derived from statistics. The parameter-basedapproach defines biodiversity as the result of a multivariate equation. Our work brings both approaches together in ahybrid approach, using predefined hemeroby intervals for different land use classes. Within the interval given by thehemeroby classes, a fuzzy system allows finer distinction. Our method allows both coarse and fine assessments ofland use impacts on biodiversity. Even within the same LCA study, both coarse and fine assessments are possible. Itallows different conservation priorities to be reflected in the assessment, but has a plausible and non-controversialdefault priority ready if the complex goal “high biodiversity” is not suitably defined for any given ecoregion.

> The parameter-based approach defines biodiversity as the result of a
multivariate equation which describes the biodiversity value of the land. Examples are given in e.g. Michelsen (2008) and Lindner (2016).

> Parameter-based methods provide highly specific case study results, which are difficult to generalize to the global level.
