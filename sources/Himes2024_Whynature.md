>[!abstract]-
>In this article, we present results from a literature review of intrinsic, instrumental, and relational values of nature conducted for the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, as part of the Methodological Assessment of the Diverse Values and Valuations of Nature. We identify the most frequently recurring meanings in the heterogeneous use of different value types and their association with worldviews and other key concepts. From frequent uses, we determine a core meaning for each value type, which is sufficiently inclusive to serve as an umbrella over different understandings in the literature and specific enough to help highlight its difference from the other types of values. Finally, we discuss convergences, overlapping areas, and fuzzy boundaries between different value types to facilitate dialogue, reduce misunderstandings, and improve the methods for valuation of nature's contributions to people, including ecosystem services, to inform policy and direct future research.

### context
>Intergovernmental SciencePolicy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) commissioned and approved the Methodological Assessment of the Diverse Values and Valuations of Nature
### summary of views
![[Himes2024_Whynature_values.png]]
### proposed definition for intrinsic value of nature
> values of other-than-human beings expressed independently of any reference to humans as valuers, including values associated with entities worth protecting as ends in and of themselves.
### intrinsic vs instrumental histories
>In earlier science–policy interface documents, such as the MEA, mainly intrinsic and instrumental values are presented and typ- ically depicted in dichotomic opposition (something may either have dignity—intrinsic value—or a price—instrumental value; MEA 2005). This dichotomy is represented in the salient artic- ulation of intrinsic values defined negatively as noninstrumen- tal value but can be further mapped onto two predominant ap- proaches in the general environmental discourse. For instance, the fields of conservation biology and environmental ethics both invoke salient articulations of intrinsic values as the value of natural processes and systems “regardless of importance or use- fulness to humans” and “the inherent moral value of natu- ral beings (right to exist).” With the introduction of the CBD and the ecosystem services framework, instrumental (and rela- tional) language has become more relevant in the debate (Norton 1991, Justus et al. 2009, Sagoff 2009, Batavia and Nelson 2017). In the sustainability discourse and in environmental and ecologi- cal economics, the language of instrumental value is increasingly dominant, primarily emphasizing the salient articulation of na- ture’s value as a resource for ecosystem services, as an asset, cap- ital, or property (Daily 1997, TEEB 2010)
