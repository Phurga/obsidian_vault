>[!abstract]-
>Classifying organisms has a wide use and a long history in ecology. However, the meaning of a ‘group of organisms’ and how to group organisms is still the subject of much theoretical and empirical work. Achieving this long quest requires simplifying the complexity of species niches for which relevant morphological, behavioural, biochemical or life-history traits are often used as relevant proxies. Soil fauna is highly diverse and many classifications have been proposed to synthesize both the response of soil organisms to their environment and their effect on soil functioning. Here, we provide a critical overview of the characteristics and limitations of the existing classifications in soil ecology, and propose clarifications and alternatives to current practices. We summarise the similarities and differences in how classifications have been created and used in soil ecology. We propose a harmonization of the current concepts by properly defining ‘guilds’, ‘functional groups’ and ‘trophic groups’ as subcategories of ‘ecological groups’, with different purposes and distinguishing criteria. Finally, based on these concepts, we suggest a common framework to define classifications based on functional traits that allows a better and unified understanding of changes in soil biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.

[[soil biodiversity]] and organisms classfications
> When considering the soil fauna as a whole, organisms are often classified (i) by taxonomy (hereafter called ‘clades’, e.g. [Lumbricidae](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/lumbricidae "Learn more about Lumbricidae from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), [Collembola](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/collembola "Learn more about Collembola from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), or Nematoda), (ii) according to their [body size](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/body-size "Learn more about body size from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") (i.e. macro-, meso- and micro-fauna; [Swift et al., 1979](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016706122003809#b0860), [Gobat et al., 1998](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016706122003809#b0345), [Gongalsky et al., 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016706122003809#b0355)), (iii) into trophic groups to aid the analysis of food webs (e.g. [predatory mites](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/predatory-mites "Learn more about predatory mites from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), bacterivorous nematodes; [de Ruiter et al., 1996](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016706122003809#b0215), [Sechi et al., 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016706122003809#b0810), [Bloor et al., 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016706122003809#b0060)), or (iv) according to their functional role, for example the soil [ecosystem engineers](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/ecosystem-engineers "Learn more about ecosystem engineers from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") (i.e., organisms that directly or indirectly modulate the availability of resources to other species, by causing physical state changes in biotic or abiotic materials) ([Lavelle et al., 1997](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016706122003809#b0560)).

> a more detailed overarching classification that merged existing group-specific classifications using a hybrid taxonomic-and-trait approach was suggested ([Potapov et al., 2022a](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016706122003809#b0745)). However, the definition of groups in the classifications listed above depends on the appreciation by specialists of the main role of the organisms. For example, [Lavelle (1997)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016706122003809#b0555) included [macroinvertebrates](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/macroinvertebrate "Learn more about macroinvertebrates from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") as ecosystem engineers, whereas [Brussaard (2012)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016706122003809#b0140) added fungi to this group.


[[species trait|functional trait]]
> From an ecosystem ecology point of view, a functional group gathers individuals that contribute similarly to an environmental function ([Blondel, 2003](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016706122003809#b0055)). Therefore, the concept of ‘functional group’ is tightly interlinked to the concept of ‘functional trait’, despite the latter being adapted to [soil ecology](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/soil-ecology "Learn more about soil ecology from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") only recently ([Pey et al., 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016706122003809#b0705)). For an individual, a trait is functional if it contributes to its fitness ([Violle et al., 2007](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016706122003809#b0890)). Functional traits are involved in the response of individuals to their environment but they also influence their environment. The applications of these concepts in soil fauna ecology are far from clear and often blurred by misuses ([Pey et al., 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016706122003809#b0705)) with a persistent lack of consistency in concepts and terminology in soil ecology ([Blondel, 2003](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016706122003809#b0055), [Lavorel and Garnier, 2002](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016706122003809#b0575), [Pey et al., 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016706122003809#b0705)). To simplify the semantics in soil ecology and to conform with other fields of ecology, we propose to clarify definitions of ecological groups, guilds, functional groups and trophic groups (Box 1). The guild concept refers to resource sharing by species in a competitive way whereas the functional group concept essentially corresponds to the way individuals act on resources to provide an ecological function ([Blondel, 2003](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016706122003809#b0055), [Wilson, 1999](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016706122003809#b0915)).

Definitions
> **Ecological group:** group of individuals that show similar environmental tolerances and similar effects on their environment. This is the overarching concept that includes guilds, functional groups and trophic groups as sub-concepts.
> **Guild**: group of species that largely overlap in their niche requirements ([Grinnell, 1917](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016706122003809#b0390), [Root, 1967](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016706122003809#b0765)).
> **Functional group**: group of individuals that similarly contribute to a specific ecological function ([Dı́az and Cabido, 2001](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016706122003809#b0235)). An ecological function is a change in matter and/or energy flows in an ecosystem, resulting from interactions between organisms or between organisms and their physical environment.
> **Trophic group**: group of individuals that feed on the same food sources and have the same consumers ([O’Connor et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016706122003809#b0660), [Bloor et al., 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016706122003809#b0060)). For instance, plant feeding nematodes and [weevil](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/weevil "Learn more about weevil from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") larvae do not belong to the same trophic group as they do not share the same predators, although they belong to the same [trophic level](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/trophic-level "Learn more about trophic level from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") (both feed on plant roots). Therefore, trophic groups can be perceived both as guilds and/or as functional groups (but the converse is not necessarily true).
