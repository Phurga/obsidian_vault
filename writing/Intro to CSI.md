## hook
What is the contribution of our material consumption to the ecologic crisis ? With the environmentalist movement developping in the end 20th century, scholars are researching methods to answer such questions. 
## global products and life cycle analysis
### global products
Most modern products consumed in local markets are in fact linked to a global industrial and commercial network. No European market without African ore, Chinese factories or American oil. Assessing the environmental impacts of these products first requires the definition of the complete network of activities involved in its use. It also requires being able to define the environmental impacts of any of these activities, accounting for regional contexts. 
### life cycle analysis
The life cycle assessment framework [@ISO2006_ISO14040] aims at adressing this challenge, by considering the environmental impacts of a product through a "product system" perspective. This product system links all activities involved with the use of the product, both upstream (production, logistics etc) and downstream (end of life treatments). Any activity can be brought down to a list of exchanges with the environment (elementary flows), marking a potential human-induced environmental impact. The framework considers a range of environmental issues (such as climate change, eutrophication, water scarcity) to which elementary flows are linked to via coefficients (characterization factors) translating exchanges with the environment into environmental impacts. A cause-effect chain can be established to derive environmental issues results into damage on humans or biodiversity [@UNEP2016_GlobalGuidance; @Verones2017_LCIAframework].
## ecosystem quality
### ecosystem quality or biodiversity
Life cycle assessment is considers nature as an area of protection, named "ecosystem quality". Nature is a multidimensional and sometimes subjective concept, and thus the exact definition of this area of protection has evolved over time [@Koellner2013_Principleslife; @Curran2016_HowWell; @Verones2017_LCIAframework; @Debarre2025_RevampingLCIA]. Defining ecosystem quality as a way of "intrinsic value of nature" conflicts with [@IPBES2022_SummaryPolicymakers] definition stating that "the value inherent to nature, independent of human experience and evaluation, and thus beyond the scope of anthropocentric valuation approaches" [@Debarre2025_RevampingLCIA]. Herein will be used the term "biodiversity", rather than "ecosystem quality". Biodiversity as an area of protection is considered to better follow the trends in conservation biology [@Curran2016_HowWell], the scientific discipline focusing on "provid\[ing] principles and tools for preserving biological diversity" [@Soule1985_WhatConservation]. Biodiversity is here considered as it is defined by the convention on biological diversity [@CBD2011_ConventionBiological] "the variability among living organisms from all sources including, inter alia, terrestrial, marine and other aquatic ecosystems and the ecological complexes of which they are part; this includes diversity within species, between species and of ecosystems".
### link with ecosystem services
### measure biodiversity, not nature, nor ecosystem quality
Human value nature for different reasons. Under an anthropocentric paradigm, nature is considered as a resource for human to live from. Human societies rely on local and global ecosystem function. Nature delivers critical services such as regulating services (e.g. air and water filtration), provisioning services (e.g. food, wood or any biotic material) and cultural services (recreational and others) [@FabisConsultingLtd2023_CommonInternational].
A second paradigm is biocentric. It considers a responsibility for humans to respect a right for other living beings to exist [@IPBES2022_SummaryPolicymakers]. The normative postulates of conservation biology [@Soule1985_WhatConservation] can be used to guide the definition of 

Both paradigms recognizes a need for proper ecosystem functioning but different perspectives induce different value indicators. An anthropocentric world view leads to indicators tracking ecosystems capacity to sustaining human activity, for instance monetary indicators. A biocentric world view leads to indicators tracking of ecosystem integrity, such as biomass production or community composition indicators.

Biodiversity is involved in ecosystems functionning and thus in the delivery of ecosystem services [@IPBES2019_GlobalAssessment]. However these two valuation processes are separated in life cycle assessment.  quantifying any loss of services due to the degradation of ecosystems is not the focus of this area of protection. [@Debarre2025_RevampingLCIA] proposes a cause-effect pathway relating biodiversity (as ecosystem quality) and ecosystem services.

### nature, ecosystems, biodiversity
#### nature
Humans are now able to exert massive pressures on natural environments, degrading ecosystems structure, accelerating the loss of species beyond sustainable rates, threathening ecosystem function at local and global scale.
#### ecosystems
An ecosystem is the base unit of nature, a community of organisms interacting with its environment. The biosphere hosts a great diversity of environmental conditions (biotopes), and evolutionary processes have favoured the development of millions of species, inhabiting these biotopes.
