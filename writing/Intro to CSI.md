## hook
What is the contribution of our material consumption to the ecologic crisis ? With the environmentalist movement developping in the end 20th century, scholars are researching methods to answer such questions. 
## global products and life cycle analysis
### global products
Most modern products consumed in local markets are in fact linked to a global industrial and commercial network. No European market without African ore, Chinese factories or American oil. Assessing the environmental impacts of these products first requires defining the complete network of activities it involves. It also requires being able to define the environmental impacts of any of these activities, accounting for regional contexts. 
### life cycle analysis
The life cycle assessment framework [@ISO2006_ISO14040] aims at adressing this challenge, by considering the environmental impacts of a product through a "product system" perspective. This product system links all activities involved with the use of the product, both upstream (production, logistics etc) and downstream (end of life treatments). Any activity can be brought down to a list of exchanges with the environment (elementary flows), marking a potential human-induced environmental impact. The framework considers a range of environmental issues (such as climate change, eutrophication, water scarcity) to which elementary flows are linked to via coefficients (characterization factors) translating exchanges with the environment into environmental impacts. A cause-effect chain can be established to derive environmental issues results into damage on humans or biodiversity [@UNEP2016_GlobalGuidance; @Verones2017_LCIAframework].
## area of protection
### ecosystem quality or biodiversity
Human value nature for different reasons. Under an anthropocentric paradigm, nature is considered as a resource for human to live from. Under a biocentric paradigm, nature is considered as a system composed of non-human beings with a right to exist regardless of their relation to humans [@IPBES2022_SummaryPolicymakers]. An ecocentric paradigm also exists, valuing the ecosystem as a whole and thus not only its organismal community but also the abiotic environment.

These two paradigms lead to the definition of two end goals in social policies: anthropocentrism to protecting human beings and biocentrism to protecting non-human beings as well. We will use this to consider two end goals This [@Koellner2013_UNEPSETACGuideline; @Curran2016_HowWell; @Verones2017_LCIAframework; @Debarre2025_RevampingLCIA]. Defining ecosystem quality as focusing on the "intrinsic value of nature" conflicts with the [@IPBES2022_SummaryPolicymakers] definition of intrinsic value of nature: "the value inherent to nature, independent of human experience and evaluation, and thus *beyond the scope of anthropocentric valuation approaches*" [@Debarre2025_RevampingLCIA]. 

Herein will be used the term "biodiversity", rather than "ecosystem quality". Biodiversity as an area of protection is considered to better follow the trends in conservation biology [@Curran2016_HowWell;@Soule1985_WhatConservation;@IPBES2019_GlobalAssessment]^[conservation biology is the the scientific discipline focusing on "provid\[ing\] principles and tools for preserving biological diversity"]. We will consider the definition of the convention on biological diversity "biodiversity is the variability among living organisms from all sources including, inter alia, terrestrial, marine and other aquatic ecosystems and the ecological complexes of which they are part; this includes diversity within species, between species and of ecosystems" [@CBD2011_ConventionBiological].
### biodiversity and ecosystem services
Both paradigms recognizes a need for proper ecosystem functioning but different perspectives induce different value indicators. An anthropocentric world view is aligned with the ecosystem services framework, including regulating services (e.g. air and water filtration), provisioning services (e.g. food, wood or any biotic material) and cultural services (recreational and others) [@FabisConsultingLtd2023_CommonInternational]. Relevant indicators can track ecosystems capacity to sustain human activity, for instance monetary indicators. A biocentric world view is more aligned with the normative postulates of conservation biology, such as valuing biological diversity, valuing species, as embodiements of evolutionary processes, or valuing ecological complexity [@Soule1985_WhatConservation]. Relevant indicators can track community composition its simplest form being species richness.

Biodiversity is involved in ecosystems functionning and thus in the delivery of ecosystem services [@IPBES2019_GlobalAssessment]. However, quantifying any loss of services due to the degradation of ecosystems is not the focus of this area of protection. [@Debarre2025_RevampingLCIA] proposes a cause-effect pathway relating biodiversity (as ecosystem quality) and ecosystem services.
