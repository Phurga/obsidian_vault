## hook
What is the contribution of our material consumption to the ecologic crisis ? With the environmentalist movement developping in the end 20th century, scholars are researching methods to answer such questions. 
## global products and life cycle analysis
### global products
Most modern products consumed in local markets are in fact linked to a global industrial and commercial network. No European market without African ore, Chinese factories or American oil. Assessing the environmental impacts of these products first requires the definition of the complete network of activities involved in its use. It also requires being able to define the environmental impacts of any of these activities, accounting for regional contexts. 
### life cycle analysis
The life cycle assessment framework [@ISO2006_ISO14040] aims at adressing this challenge, by considering the environmental impacts of a product through a "product system" perspective. This product system links all activities involved with the use of the product, both upstream (production, logistics etc) and downstream (end of life treatments). Any activity can be brought down to a list of exchanges with the environment (elementary flows), marking a potential human-induced environmental impact. The framework considers a range of environmental issues (such as climate change, eutrophication, water scarcity) to which elementary flows are linked to via coefficients (characterization factors) translating exchanges with the environment into environmental impacts. A cause-effect chain can be established to derive environmental issues results into damage on humans or biodiversity [@UNEP2016_GlobalGuidance; @Verones2017_LCIAframework].
## ecosystem quality
### a biodiversity endpoint
Life cycle assessment is considers nature as an area of protection, named "ecosystem quality". Nature is a multidimensional and sometimes subjective concept, and thus the exact definition of this area of protection has evolved over time [@Koellner2013_Principleslife; @Curran2016_HowWell; @Verones2017_LCIAframework; @Debarre2025_RevampingLCIA]. Herein will be used "biodiversity", rather than "ecosystem quality", considered to better follow the trends in conservation biology [@Curran2016_HowWell], the scientific discipline focusing on "provid\[ing] principles and tools for preserving biological diversity" [@Soule1985_WhatConservation].  Biodiversity is here used as it is defined by the convention on biological diversity [@CBD2011_ConventionBiological], representing the diversity of life beyond species. 
### link with ecosystem services
Human societies rely on local and global ecosystem function, delivering critical services such as regulation services (e.g. air and water filtration), provisioning services (e.g. food, wood or any biotic material) and cultural services (recreational and others) [@FabisConsultingLtd2023_CommonInternational].
Biodiversity is involved in ecosystems functionning and so in the delivery of nature contributions to people, also named ecosystem services [@IPBES2019_GlobalAssessment]. However valuing these services and quantifying any loss of services due to the degradation of ecosystems is not the focus of this area of protection. [@Debarre2025_RevampingLCIA] proposes a cause-effect pathway relating biodiversity (as ecosystem quality) and ecosystem services.

### nature conservation and environmental ethics
#### historics on environmentalism and ecosystem services
Two stances in environmental ethics induce a valuation of nature. An anthropocentric paradigm, considering nature as a resource for us to live from. Nature benefits humans  A biocentric paradigm, where human live with nature and acknowledge the right for non-human beings to exist. This induces a responsibility for human to limit their impacts on nature as they interact with their environment [@IPBES2022_SummaryPolicymakers; @Himes2024_WhyNature; @Sandler2012_IntrinsicValue].

Both paradigms recognizes a need for proper ecosystem functioning but different perspectives induce different value indicators.

Nature protection is also considered under an anthropocentric paradigm: ecosystems, through their fonctionning, deliver key services to human populations are being degraded at scales challenging their ability to function and deliver key services for human societies. These services include environmental regulation (such as regulating air and water quality), food and material provision, and non material services (e.g. aesthetical or psychological) [@IPBES2019_Globalassessment].
### nature, ecosystems, biodiversity
#### nature
Humans are now able to exert massive pressures on natural environments, degrading ecosystems structure, accelerating the loss of species beyond sustainable rates, threathening ecosystem function at local and global scale.
#### ecosystems
An ecosystem is the base unit of nature, a community of organisms interacting with its environment. The biosphere hosts a great diversity of environmental conditions (biotopes), and evolutionary processes have favoured the development of millions of species, inhabiting these biotopes.
