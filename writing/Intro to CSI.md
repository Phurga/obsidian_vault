## hook
What is the contribution of our material consumption to the ecologic crisis ? With the environmentalist movement developping in the end 20th century, scholars are researching methods to answer such questions. 
## global products and life cycle analysis
### global products
Most modern products consumed in local markets are in fact linked to a global industrial and commercial network. Assessing the environmental impacts of these products first requires defining the complete network of activities it involves. It also requires being able to define the environmental impacts of any of these activities, accounting for regional contexts. 
### life cycle analysis
The life cycle assessment (LCA) framework [@ISO2006_ISO14040] aims at adressing this challenge, by considering the environmental impacts of a product through a "product system" perspective. This product system links all activities involved with the use of the product, both upstream (production, logistics etc) and downstream (end of life treatments). Any activity can be brought down to a list of exchanges with the environment (elementary flows), marking a potential human-induced environmental impact. The framework considers a range of environmental issues (such as climate change, eutrophication, water scarcity) to which elementary flows are linked to via coefficients (characterization factors) translating exchanges with the environment into environmental impacts. A cause-effect chain can be established to derive environmental issues results into damage on humans or biodiversity [@UNEP2016_GlobalGuidance; @Verones2017_LCIAframework].
## nature valuation and protection
### ecosystem quality or biodiversity
Human value nature for different reasons. Under an anthropocentric paradigm, nature is considered as a resource for human to live from. Under a biocentric paradigm, nature is considered as a system composed of non-human beings with a right to exist regardless of their relation to humans [@IPBES2022_SummaryPolicymakers]. An ecocentric paradigm also exists, valuing the ecosystem as a whole and thus not only its organismal community but also the abiotic environment.

These two paradigms lead to the definition of two end goals in social policies: anthropocentrism to protecting human beings and biocentrism to protecting non-human beings as well. Areas of protection in LCA have evolved over time and are still debated. Especially, how damage on the natural environment should be considered has long been debated [@Koellner2013_UNEPSETACGuideline; @Curran2016_HowWell; @Verones2017_LCIAframework; @Debarre2025_RevampingLCIA]. Herein I propose to consider an area of protection for non-human beings, under the term "biodiversity" (rather than "ecosystem quality"). Biodiversity being more aligned with concepts of conservation biology and environmental policy [@Curran2016_HowWell;@Soule1985_WhatConservation;@IPBES2019_GlobalAssessment;@CBD2011_ConventionBiological].
### biodiversity and ecosystem services
Considering the instrumental value of nature is aligned with the ecosystem services framework [@Costanza1997_ValueWorlds;@FabisConsultingLtd2023_CommonInternational]. Biodiversity affects ecosystems functionning and thus the delivery of ecosystem services [@IPBES2019_GlobalAssessment]. Biodiversity is correlated with ecosystem functioning (e.g. productivity, resilience) and thus biodiversity is known to correlate with ecosystem services [@Hooper2005_EffectsBiodiversity]. However, quantifying any loss of services due to the degradation of ecosystems is not the focus of this area of protection. [@Debarre2025_RevampingLCIA] proposes a cause-effect pathway relating biodiversity (as ecosystem quality) and ecosystem services.

## biodiversity
### definition
Biological diversity (biodiversity) is the diversity of life. More complex definitions attempting to capture the multidimensionality of this concept exist. The convention on biological diversity defines biodiversity as "the variability among living organisms from all sources including, inter alia, terrestrial, marine and other aquatic ecosystems and the ecological complexes of which they are part; this includes diversity within species, between species and of ecosystems" [@CBD2011_ConventionBiological].

This definition highlights the need to consider diversity beyond species, the latter being subject to particular focus. For instance, genetic diversity inside species populations is required to maintain evolutionary potential [@Willi2022_Conservationgenetics] and increases overall functional diversity [@Violle2007_Letconcept]. Ecosystem diversity refers to diversity beyond organisms. The diversity of environmental conditions on Earth and the complexity of ecological communities give identity to ecosystems. Ecological communities display unique compositions (how much species, under which abundances) but also structures (spatial patterns, temporal patterns) leading to specific processes and function (trophic relationships, biotic productivity).

### species in biodiversity
Species is a central concept in biology and ecology, although one definition fitting all life forms is challenging [@Anthony2023_EnumeratingSoil;@Doolittle2006_Genomicsbacterial]. It is nonetheless very useful to simplify the complexity of biodiversity and derive indicators and is thus central in conservation policies [@CBD2022_KunmingMontrealGlobal].
Species are valued and their diversity is too. There are two angles leading to species valuation [@Sandler2012_IntrinsicValue]. Species are usually classified into taxons, historically based on a shared characteristics, and nowadays based on evolutionary history (phylogeny). Some known groups of species remain based on morphology and not on phylogeny, such as reptiles or fishes.
