## base question
What is the contribution of our material consumption to the ecologic crisis ? With the environmentalist movement developping in the end 20th century, scholars are researching methods to answer such questions. 
## global products and life cycle analysis
In the current globalised economy, most modern products consumed in local markets are in fact linked to a global industrial and commercial network. No European market without African ore, Chinese factories or American oil. Assessing the environmental impacts of these products first requires the definition of the complete system enabling its existence. It also requires being able to define environmental impacts of any activity involved, accounting for regional contexts. 

The life cycle assessment framework [@ISO2006_ISO14040] aims at adressing this challenge, by considering the environmental impacts of a product through a "product system" perspective. This product system links all activities involved with the use of the product, both upstream (production, logistics etc) and downstream (end of life treatments). Any activity can be brought down to a list of exchanges with the environment (elementary flows), marking a potential human-induced environmental impact. The framework considers a range of environmental issues (such as climate change, eutrophication, water scarcity) to which elementary flows are linked to via coefficients (characterization factors) translating exchanges with the environment into environmental impacts. A cause-effect chain can be established to derive environmental issues results into damage on "areas of protection", such as human health and ecosystem quality [@UNEP2016_GlobalGuidance; @Verones2017_LCIAframework].

Ecosystem quality refers to the intactness of natural ecosystems.
Herein we will focus on how land transformed for human activities is a degraded of natural habitat.
## measures of 
### nature conservation, environmental ethics
Limiting nature degradation can be the outcome of two ethical paradigms.
Under a biocentric paradigm, human "live with nature" and acknowledge the right for non-human beings to exist. This induces a responsibility for human to limit their impacts on nature as they interact with their environment (stewardship) [@IPBES2022_SummaryPolicymakers].
Nature protection is also considered under an anthropocentric paradigm: ecosystems, through their fonctionning, deliver key services to human populations are being degraded at scales challenging their ability to function and deliver key services for human societies. These services include environmental regulation (such as regulating air and water quality), food and material provision, and non material services (e.g. aesthetical or psychological) [@IPBES2019_Globalassessment].
### nature, ecosystems, biodiversity
Humans are now able to exert massive pressures on natural environments, degrading ecosystems structure, accelerating the loss of species beyond sustainable rates, threathening ecosystem function at local and global scale.
An ecosystem is the base unit of nature, a community of organisms interacting with its environment. The biosphere hosts a great diversity of environmental conditions (biotopes), and evolutionary processes have favoured the development of millions of species, inhabiting these biotopes.
