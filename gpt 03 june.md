## Integrating Soil Biodiversity into LCA: Themes and Research Questions

**Main Thematic Areas:** The user’s notes emphasize several interrelated themes at the interface of soil ecology and life cycle assessment (LCA). One major area is **biodiversity-focused LCA methodology**. Recent reviews note that current LCA biodiversity impact methods (both expert‐scoring and indicator‐based) struggle to account for land management intensity and on-site vs off-site effects. There is a recognized need to align LCA cause–effect chains with conservation frameworks (e.g. Essential Biodiversity Variables) and to include land-use intensity as a factor. In particular, **characterization factors (CFs)** for terrestrial biodiversity impacts are a key topic. CFs (often expressed as the Potentially Disappeared Fraction of species) have been developed for aboveground taxa (e.g. plant species loss in organic vs conventional fields), but analogous CFs for soil organisms are largely missing.

- **Soil biodiversity and metrics:** Soil ecosystems host vast microbial, fungal, and invertebrate diversity, which drive crucial functions. Measuring soil biodiversity is challenging: traditional surveys are laborious, whereas environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding can _simultaneously detect microorganisms, fungi, invertebrates and plants from a soil sample_. The user’s work likely involves evaluating soil biodiversity indicators (species richness, taxonomic diversity, functional groups) and how they respond to disturbance or land use.
    
- **Land use and management impacts:** How agricultural and other land-use practices affect soil biota is a core theme. Conversion from natural to cropland or pasture often reduces soil species richness and alters community composition. For example, field studies have shown organic fields support higher plant and likely also soil fauna diversity than conventional fields. LCA researchers highlight that distinguishing management regimes (organic vs conventional) in CFs is important. The notes likely cover different land uses (forests, grasslands, cropping) and intensities (tillage, inputs) and their effects on soil communities.
    
- **Characterization factors for soil biota:** A critical aim is deriving **CFs that quantify human damage to soil organisms** per unit land use. In LCA, CFs translate land occupation or transformation into biodiversity loss (e.g. fraction of species lost). Existing CFs (e.g. Knudsen et al. for temperate farmland plants) are based on field surveys of aboveground taxa. The user is likely exploring how to establish similar factors for belowground taxa: e.g. using eDNA diversity changes to compute a Potentially Disappeared Fraction of soil microorganisms or invertebrates under various land uses. This is a novel thematic intersection, as standard CFs rarely incorporate soil taxa explicitly.
    
- **eDNA and molecular tools:** Environmental DNA is a highlighted theme. eDNA metabarcoding is emerging as a **transformative tool for biodiversity assessment**, because it can rapidly and non‐invasively survey a wide range of taxa. The notes likely discuss eDNA protocols for soil (sampling, sequencing of 16S/18S/COI etc.), and its promise for monitoring soil health. They may also cover challenges (standardization, data interpretation). Importantly, eDNA data could be used to inform LCA. For example, one review suggests shifting toward “bottom-up” eDNA-driven biodiversity monitoring to inform impact assessments.
    
- **Remote sensing and land cover mapping:** Remote sensing is another key area. Satellite or airborne data (e.g. NDVI indices, LiDAR canopy structure) can capture habitat characteristics over large areas. Studies have found that vegetation structure and cover are correlated with belowground microbial diversity. For instance, LiDAR-derived forest heterogeneity was shown to predict soil bacterial and fungal community composition in a U.S. forest study. In an LCA context, remote sensing could provide spatially continuous proxies for land-use intensity and habitat condition, helping to scale up site-based biodiversity measurements. The notes probably include how to integrate remote sensing variables (e.g. soil moisture from radar, crop indices) with field biodiversity data.
    
- **Integrated biodiversity mapping (eDNA + remote sensing):** A synthesis theme is the **combination of eDNA and Earth observation**. Recent ecological applications demonstrate that coupling eDNA samples with environmental predictors (climate layers, Sentinel-2 imagery, topography) can predict community diversity patterns. This suggests one can create landscape‐scale biodiversity baselines using a few point eDNA samples plus spatial data. The user’s notes may explore how such approaches could be adapted for soils: e.g. linking soil DNA surveys to vegetation or soil property maps to predict soil biodiversity across a region. This thematic area is cutting-edge, aiming to bridge detailed molecular data and broad-scale LCA needs.
    

**Potential Research Questions:** Based on these themes, we propose several novel questions that could yield new insights at the intersection of soil ecology and LCA. Each question is intended to uncover gaps or advance methods for integrating soil biota into biodiversity impact assessment:

- How can **eDNA-derived soil community data** be used to calculate characterization factors for biodiversity in LCA? For example, can the loss or gain in microbial or invertebrate taxa (from eDNA surveys) under different land uses be translated into a Potentially Disappeared Fraction for soil biodiversity?
    
- Which **land-use intensity metrics** derived from remote sensing (e.g. NDVI, land-cover diversity, canopy height variation) best correlate with soil biodiversity metrics from eDNA, and can these be used to extrapolate soil biota diversity across landscapes?
    
- How do different **agricultural management practices** (e.g. tillage intensity, organic amendments, crop rotations) affect soil eDNA biodiversity signals, and how could these differences be encoded into LCA characterization factors?
    
- Can **machine learning models** that integrate eDNA data and environmental variables (remote sensing, soil maps) classify soil biodiversity status or predict taxa loss under land use changes, thereby improving spatially explicit impact assessment?
    
- What are the **key indicator taxa or functions** (e.g. nematodes, mycorrhizal fungi) in soil eDNA data that serve as proxies for ecosystem health, and how can their presence/absence be linked to LCA endpoints?
    
- How do existing terrestrial biodiversity CFs (often based on plants or vertebrates) compare to soil biodiversity patterns measured by eDNA, and what adjustments are needed to account for soil organisms in LCA models?
    
- Can the concept of **Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBVs)** be operationalized for soils using eDNA and remote-sensed data to create standardized inputs for LCA impact categories?
    
- How does **spatial scale** (plot vs landscape) influence the integration of soil eDNA and remote sensing data for LCA? For instance, what resolution of satellite data is needed to capture meaningful soil biodiversity gradients?
    

**Recommended Questions for First Article:** Among these, we recommend focusing on questions that are both novel and feasible given the user’s data on soil ecology, eDNA, and remote sensing. In particular:

- **How can eDNA metabarcoding of soil organisms be translated into life cycle impact characterization factors (e.g. potentially disappeared fraction of taxa) for different land use categories?** This question directly targets the gap in LCA (lack of soil biodiversity CFs) and leverages the user’s eDNA datasets. By quantifying species loss in soil biota between natural and managed systems, the study could propose new CF values for LCA models.
    
- **Can remote sensing metrics (such as vegetation structure or indices) predict soil biodiversity patterns observed via eDNA, enabling spatial extrapolation of soil biota impacts in LCA?** This explores the innovative use of Earth observation to scale up site-specific eDNA findings. Demonstrating predictive links (for example using gradient forest models as in Lin et al. 2021) would be novel and could make LCA inventories more spatially explicit.
    
- **How do soil biodiversity outcomes (from eDNA surveys) differ between conventional and organic farming, and how can these differences be incorporated into LCA characterization factors?** Given known differences in aboveground biodiversity, a parallel analysis for soil communities would be valuable. The result could be differentiated CFs for organic vs conventional land use, addressing a noted LCA need.
    

These questions combine the thematic areas of LCA methodology, eDNA, remote sensing, and land use impacts. They are likely to yield publishable findings by filling a clear gap (soil biodiversity in LCA) and applying cutting-edge tools (eDNA/metabarcoding and remote sensing) to the problem.

**References:** The proposed themes and questions are informed by recent literature. For example, LCA reviews stress the need for land-management-sensitive biodiversity models, while ecologists highlight the potential of eDNA metabarcoding for broad biodiversity monitoring. Studies have begun linking eDNA with remote sensing to predict community diversity, and demonstrate that aerial habitat metrics can correlate with soil microbial diversity. Meanwhile, characterisation-factor studies show how field biodiversity data (though so far mainly aboveground) can yield LCA impact factors. These insights guide the suggested research directions for integrating soil biodiversity into LCA.
# q2
could you help me in the selection of an indicator to base the characterization factors on, accounting for the current knowledge of soil ecology and the limited availability of data regarding soil organisms and their biogeography ?
In lca for instance, species richness loss (relative species loss, or potential disappeared fraction of species) is the go to metric, but is it relevant for soil organisms ? are there other metrics that would be relevant ? I am thinking of soil functions or gene diversity or multi-trophic diversity metrics but there could be others
# r2
Absolutely — selecting the right indicator for your **soil biodiversity characterization factors (CFs)** is a central scientific and methodological decision in your PhD. Below, I’ll walk you through a systematic approach to choosing an indicator, balancing:

- **Ecological relevance** (i.e. it meaningfully reflects soil ecosystem change)
    
- **Feasibility and data availability** (i.e. it can be measured robustly across sites and linked to land use)
    
- **Compatibility with LCA requirements** (i.e. it allows spatial and management comparisons, and quantification of relative “damage”)
    



## 🔷 1. Benchmark: What LCA Typically Uses

In LCA, the most widely used indicator is:

### ✅ **Relative Species Richness Loss / Potentially Disappeared Fraction of Species (PDF)**

- This expresses biodiversity loss as a **proportion of species lost** relative to a reference state (typically “natural” or “minimally disturbed”).
    
- Used in e.g. **GLOBIO, ReCiPe, Chappell et al. 2021, Knudsen et al. 2022** for aboveground taxa.
    

**But… for soil organisms?**

- 🟠 **Problems:**
    
    - Poor taxonomic resolution for many soil taxa (e.g. bacteria, protists).
        
    - High local diversity & turnover (β-diversity) make regional patterns hard to define.
        
    - Lack of reference baselines: What is “natural richness” for bacteria in a temperate cropland?
        



## 🔶 2. Alternative or Complementary Indicators for Soil Biodiversity

### 2.1. **Gene (Molecular) Diversity / ASV Richness**

- What: Number of **amplicon sequence variants (ASVs)** or **operational taxonomic units (OTUs)** in eDNA data.
    
- Reflects fine-scale diversity (especially for microbes, fungi).
    
- ✅ Good for reproducibility and comparison across sites.
    
- ❌ May overestimate “species” counts; hard to link directly to functional or ecosystem-level outcomes.
    

### 2.2. **Functional Diversity or Trait-Based Metrics**

- What: Number of different **functions or ecological roles** represented (e.g. decomposers, nitrifiers, predators).
    
- Based on taxon-function assignments from e.g. **FAPROTAX** (for bacteria), **FUNGuild** (fungi), or **trophic groupings** (macrofauna).
    
- ✅ Closely linked to soil ecosystem functions (nutrient cycling, disease control).
    
- ✅ Possibly less sensitive to taxonomy gaps.
    
- ❌ Requires robust functional annotation databases.
    

### 2.3. **Soil Function Surrogates**

- What: Direct measurement or proxy of **soil ecosystem functions**: e.g. decomposition rate, enzyme activity, respiration, nitrogen mineralization.
    
- ✅ Ecologically meaningful; reflects consequences of biodiversity change.
    
- ❌ Not easy to generalize across regions or model spatially.
    
- ❌ Difficult to translate into LCA-compatible CFs unless linked to biodiversity proxies.
    

### 2.4. **Community Evenness or Entropy Metrics**

- What: e.g. **Shannon or Simpson diversity**, incorporating richness + abundance distribution.
    
- ✅ More stable than just richness; less sensitive to rare taxa.
    
- ❌ May be harder to interpret ecologically in LCA unless linked to function.
    

### 2.5. **Multitrophic Diversity Indices**

- What: Aggregate richness or functional diversity across several groups (e.g. bacteria + fungi + nematodes).
    
- ✅ Captures broad community-level effects of land use.
    
- ❌ Requires consistent sampling and marker coverage across groups.
    
- ✅ Can be done from single eDNA sample with multiple primers.
    



## 🔷 3. Candidate Indicators for Your CFs (Ranked)

|Candidate Indicator|Ecological Relevance|Data Availability (via eDNA)|LCA Compatibility|Comment|
||||||
|**Multitrophic Gene Diversity** (e.g. ASV richness across bacteria, fungi, invertebrates)|✅✅|✅✅|✅|Strong eDNA fit, can calculate PDF-like metrics|
|**Functional Group Richness** (annotated from taxonomy)|✅✅✅|✅|✅|Ecologically strong; depends on functional assignment databases|
|**Shannon Diversity Index (per group)**|✅|✅✅|✅|Use with care; needs contextualization|
|**Soil Function Proxy (e.g. decomposition rate)**|✅✅✅|❌|❌|Good for validation, not ideal as CF input|
|**Indicator Taxa Abundance or Presence** (e.g. earthworms, AMF)|✅✅|✅|✅|Might be simple, but narrow scope|



## 🔷 4. Recommendation

Given your goals and constraints, I recommend using a **modified PDF approach** based on **eDNA-derived multitrophic gene diversity or functional group richness**:

### ✅ Main indicator:

**Relative loss of multitrophic ASV richness or functional group diversity compared to a reference land use (e.g. natural or extensive system)**

This balances:

- **Scientific robustness** (relatively independent of taxonomic accuracy)
    
- **Feasibility** with available eDNA datasets
    
- **Interpretability** in LCA models (as a biodiversity “damage” indicator)
    

If you include **fungi, bacteria, and invertebrates**, this gives a more representative picture than single-taxon CFs.



## 🔶 5. Additional Layer (optional but valuable)

Complement this with:

- **Trait-based functions** (e.g. number of guilds or trophic strategies)
    
- **Remote sensing correlates** (e.g. using NDVI or vegetation heterogeneity as proxies)
    
- **Soil function validation** (e.g. link diversity to C/N cycling rates in a subset of sites)
    

This allows for **triangulation** between community structure, function, and land use.
