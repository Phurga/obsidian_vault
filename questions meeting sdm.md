what makes the soil abundance maps limited to french alps ? is it edna sampling ?
what is the potential for extending these maps to larger territories ? how difficult is it to change one data source in the model, esp if it is a raster (eg land cover information with similar classfication).
is there need for information on species relationship info beyond eDNA data ? any hard coded causal rules or is it 100% correlative ?
what is the basis for soil organisms classifications ? use of trophic/taxon groups instead of pure taxon or functional groups ?
is eDNA only used as true data or used for prediction as well ? 
what are your data sources for linking dna barcodes with your trophic classes ? how robust is this link ?
do you have any rules on time representativeness for your data ? eg using only datasources known to be true for year 2024 ? do you use yearly data or subyearly ? 
have you identified medium term variations in biodiversity levels challenging the temporal validity of your maps ? for instance in croplands
