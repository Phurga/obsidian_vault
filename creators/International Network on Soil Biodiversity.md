>The International Network on Soil Biodiversity (NETSOB) was established in December 2021 **to promote the sustainable use and conservation of soil biodiversity** andÂ to bring experts in this field and existing initiatives together to form the human talent that contributes to the implementation of the Global Soil Biodiversity Observatory (GLOSOB).
