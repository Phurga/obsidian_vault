Conference on new deep learning methods applied to [[species distribution model]] for large scale prediction of plant distribution.

> DeepSDM (Deep Species Distribution Models) are a modern approach to Species Distribution Modeling (SDM) that leverages deep learning techniques to predict species distributions based on environmental and occurrence data. They extend traditional SDM methods, such as MaxEnt or GLMs, by using deep neural networks to model complex, non-linear relationships between species occurrences and environmental variables. As part of this symposium, we will be welcoming some of the leading specialists in these emerging methods to discuss the latest advances, as well as their potential applications and limitations.
