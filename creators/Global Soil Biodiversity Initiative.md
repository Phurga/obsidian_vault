The **Global Soil Biodiversity Initiative (GSBI)** is a coordination of scientists to work on creating the global soil biodiversity atlas: [[PublicationsOfficeoftheEuropeanUnion2016_GlobalSoil]].
Note: I think this is the European Atlas on Soil Biodiversity that motivated this work ([[Jeffery2010_EuropeanAtlas]]).
