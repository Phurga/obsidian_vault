[[LECA]] post doc with [[Thuiller, Wilfried]]

> As a data scientist, my research generally explores the use of artificial intelligence techniques to unlock ecological knowledge from high-dimensional biodiversity observation data. In my PhD, I was interested in methods to infer species habitat preferences and asymmetric association networks using neural networks and machine learning interpretability tools. In my PostDoc, I am currently working on statistical methods to better harness the complexity of environmental DNA, in order to predict the community-level response of microorganisms along Alpine gradients.
