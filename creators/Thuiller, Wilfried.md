> I am senior research scientist (Directeur de Recherche de classe exceptionnelle, DRCE) at CNRS (National Center for Scientific Research) based in Grenoble. I am trained as both an ecologist and a biostatistician. I have several research areas including investigating the impacts of global change on biodiversity (species, functional and phylogenetic), measuring the influence of environment and habitat quality on intra-specific plant functional traits, understanding what makes a good invader and how to predict its potential distribution and finally how and why species co-exist together. I am now also deeply interested into spatial network analyses, namely how do ecological networks vary in space and time and why, and how do they influence ecosystem functioning. To work on these issues, I am conducting observational and experimental studies, simulation experiments, statistical analyses of empirical data and mechanistic modeling.
