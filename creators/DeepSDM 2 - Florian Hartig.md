cite package for training deep SDM models in R language

Idea of creating joint SDM models linking species presence based on interactions to share information between species presence

Note on deep sdm models: deep models lose the capacity to interpret presence and do not provide the definition of ecological niches (variables that are predictors of presence) thus of limited use for ecologists. However is this really an issue since anyway the general SDM are correlative SDM and thus the variables are not causal and do not really explain the presence and are not "real" predictors of presence.
